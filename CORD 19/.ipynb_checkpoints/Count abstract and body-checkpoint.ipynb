      ";  10000  the first isolation of a parvovirus from dogs, the minute virus of canines (mvc) dates from 1970 (3). the virus which was isolated from stools of healthy dogs did not appear to be associated with disease symptoms and no antigenic relationship with any of the known parvoviruses including feline panleukopenia virus (fpv) could be demonstrated (3, 15) . during the last two years parvovirus-like particles were shown to be present in feces of dogs involved in several outbreaks of a contagious diarrhea often accompanied with vomiting, in the usa, canada and australia (1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10) . in many cases intestinal lesions were very similar to those of feline panleukopenia (1, 4, lo) . a virus isolated from dogs in these outbreaks was shown to be antigenically related to fpv on the basis of a cross-reactivity in immunofluorescence (if) tests (2,4) and in serum neutralization tests (4). in the present paper we describe the demonstration of parvovirus-like particles in stools of dogs in outbreaks of contagious diarrhea often associated with vomiting in the netherlands. mortality rates were high, especially among dogs under one year of age. intestinal lesions very similar to those of feline panleukopenia were often observed in these dogs (7) . the virus isolated from stools of an affected dog showed a close antigenic relationship with fpv. 12 osterhaus, van steenis and de kreek zeist, the netherlands). n o indications of the presence of known feline viruses have ever been found in regular screening procedures in this surgically derived colony (osterhaus, unpublished observations). the animals were kept in a pressurized glove box throughout the experiments. two non-vaccinated conventionally reared male dogs about four months old were also made available by dr. a. f. angulo. they were kept in an isolated room throughout the experiments. a vaccine strain of fpv (\"dohyvac p\") together with the crandell feline kidney (crfk) cell line were kindly provided by dr. c. folkers (philips-duphar, weesp, the netherlands). the virus was propagated in monolayer cultures of these cells in leighton tubes or in roux bottles by adding the virus suspensions to cell suspensions or to settled monolayers respectively. the medium used was similar to the medium used for virus isolation procedures (see below). after an incubation period of two to three days at 37 \"c, the leighton tube cultures were used for indirect if studies and the bottle cultures were centrifuged at low speed after three cycles of freezing and thawing; the supernatants were used for hemagglutination (ha), (immune) electron microscopy (iem) and serum neutralization (sn) studies. stools were taken from dogs involved in the outbreaks of diarrhea in the netherlands either in a breeding colony for experimental animals, or in boarding kennels. serum samples were collected from dogs in the breeding colony after the outbreaks had started. in addition sera were tested from dogs of the breeding colony and from the open population in the netherlands, which had been collected about four years ago (11) . fecal samples were homogenized in 10 volumes of pbs and centrifuged a t 10,000 g. for 5 minutes. material from the supernatant-pellet interface was used as a fecal extract for em and iem. for negative contrast em the fecal extracts were applied to carbon-coated grids. after 10 minutes the grids were rinsed with distilled water and contrasted with a solution of 2 o/o phosphotungstic acid, containing 0.01 o/o bacitracin and adjusted to p h 6.2 with koh. for iem the samples were mixed with equal volumes of 1 : 10 diluted immune sera or control sera and incubated for two hours at 37oc. the reactant mixtures were applied to carbon-coated grids and negatively contrasted as described above. grids were examined at a magnification of 50,000 using a jeol 100 c electron microscope. fecal samples were diluted 1 : 10 in pbs and shaken for 15 minutes with chloroform at 4 oc. after low speed centrifugation 0.15 ml. volumes of the aqueous phases were mixed in triplicate with 1.5 ml. volumes of a freshly trypsinized suspension of madin darby canine kidney (mdck) cells. the cells were permitted to settle and grow on cover slips in leighton tubes. the suspension contained about 2 x 106 cells per ml. in eagles mem-lactalbumin hydrolysate, supplemented with 10 vo fetal calf serum and antibiotics. after an incubation period of two or three days the cultures were examined for cytopathic changes. one tube per sample was used for haematoxylin and eosin (he) staining (standard procedure), one for possible demonstration of viral antigen in an indirect if test and one for subsequent passaging. for reisolation the procedure used was similar to the original isolation procedure. however, the material was passed through a 220 nm filter (millipore@) after treatment with chloroform. h a and ha1 tests were carried out in a microtiter system (cooke engineering co.) essentially as described previously (1 1) using veronal gelatin buffer containing 0.15 o/o bovine serum albumin as a clikent. hemagglutinating antigen was prepared from a canine parvovirus-like virus (cpv), isolated during the course of these studies, by centrifuging infected roux bottle cultures three days post-infection (p. i.) at low speed after three cycles 13 of freezing and thawing. the supernatant was used as cpv hemagglutinating antigen. likewise, the supernatant from fpv infected crfk cell cultures treated in the same way were used as antigen for ha and ha1 tests. ha tests were carried out by adding a 0.75 o/o suspension from african green monkey (agm), dog, cat, swine, mouse, rat, guinea pig, chinese hamster or chicken erythrocytes, to serial twofold dilutions of the antigea preparations. after an incubation time of two hours at 4 o c the tests could be read. for ha1 tests serial twofold dilutions of kaolin treated (14) antisera were mixed with four hemagglutinating units (hau). after an incubation period of one hour at 20 oc, a 0.75 o/o erythrocyte suspension was added and the tests were further incubated and read as the ha tests. titers < 20 were regarded as non-specific. two or three days p.i. indirect if tests were performed on leighton tube cultures of mdck or crfk cultures after cold (-70 \"c) ethanol fixation, to demonstrate cpv or fpv antigen. the tests were essentially carried out as described previously for a coronavirus system (12) . a rabbit anti-dog igg and a rabbit anti-cat igg preparation kindly provided by dr. j. nagel (natl. inst. publ. hlth.), both labelled with fitc, were used as conjugates. when canine sera were used on mdck cells or when feline sera were used on crfk cells a fitc labelled protein-a preparation, also provided by dr. j. nagel, was used instead of the anti-igg conjugates. neutralization of cpv or fpv with inactivated (30 min 56 \"c) sera was demonstrated by determining the neutralization indices in mdck or crfk leighton tube cultures respectively: semi log 10 dilutions of the virus suspensions were mixed with equal volumes of 1 : 25 diluted sera and incubated for one hour at 20 oc. volumes of 0.5 ml. of these mixtures were added simultaneously to leighton tube cultures with mdck or crfk cell suspensions. three tubes were inoculated with each virus-serum mixture. after two or three days the cultures were fixed in 40/0 formaldehyde and stained with he and examined for the presence of intranuclear inclusion bodies. from these results neutralization indices were calculated. after collecting preinoculation serum samples of the two cats, one was vaccinated with two doses of a formaldehyde-inactivated panleukopenia vaccine (\"felidovac\" behringwerke ag, marburg, gdr). after four weeks this cat was boosted with another two doses of the same vaccine and serum samples were collected from both cats one week later (post-vaccination and second serum sample respectively). two weeks after the second vaccination, both cats were challenged with cpv, isolated during the course of these experiments: 1 ml. of a cpv suspension, containing about 104 tcid,, was inoculated intranasally and 1 ml. subcutaneously in both cats. the cats were checked for clinical signs daily, which included measuring of rectal temperature. white blood cell (wbc) counts were made every second day. after collecting pre-inoculation serum samples, the dogs were infected by application of about 104 tcid,, cpv directly into their stomachs using an oesophageal tube. the dogs were checked daily for overt clinical signs. post-infection sera were collected from the dogs 2ldays after experimental infection. stools from eight dogs in the breeding colony and from eight dogs in boarding kennels, which all died with symptoms of acute diarrhea, were examined in negative contrast electron microscopy. in seven samples of the first group and in six samples of the second group parvovirus-like particles were observed. both empty and full particles were found and the diameter measured 23 k 2 nm. (n. = 29). in some fecal extracts the particles appeared aggregated, but in general they were randomly distributed over the grid. the same stool suspensions used in the em studies were inoculated onto mdck cell cultures after chloroform treatment. a cytopathic agent was isolated from the stools of one dog in the breedin colony, although cytopathic in subsequent passages. intranuclear inclusion bodies very similar to those described for the later stages of fpv infected cell cultures (9) were observed in the four subsequent passages of infected mdck cells which had been stained with h e (fig. 1) . electron microscopic examination of water-disruptedy infected mdck cells revealed the same cpv particles that were found in fecal samples. the virus, which apparently passed a 220 nm. filter, could be reisolated from the same sample. hanges were minor and disappeared during pro p onged incubation periods and hemagglutination by cpv and fpv antigen cpv and fpv antigens were prepared from infected mdck (second assage) and crfk cell cultures respectively as described above and tested for hemagglutinating activity at 4 o c with erythrocyte suspensions from different animal s ecies. the results of these tests are summarized in table 1: antigen only caused agglutination of swine erythrocytes. specificity of these reactions could be assessed in ha1 tests with specific antisera produced in the experimentally infected dogs and cats as described below. erythrocytes from the other animal species were not agglutinated by cpv or fpv antigen, although some inconsistent results were obtained with rat erythrocytes. control anti en preparations, prepared similarly from non-infected mdck or crfk cu p tures did not show hemagglutinating activity. cpv antigen agg f utinated agm, cat and swine erythrocytes, whereas fpv  in ha1 tests the pre-inoculation sera of the experimentally infected dogs and cats, the ost-infection sera of these dogs, the post-vaccination serum of the cat (before cfallenge), the second serum of the non-vaccinated cat and the post-challenge sera of both cats were tested with the cpv and fpv antigen (tab.  iem test were performed with the post-vaccination (anti-fpv) serum of the cat (before experimental infection) on fecal samples of the dog from which cpv was isolated and of another dog showing cpv particles in its stools. with both fecal samples clear immune ag regates could be produced using binations used in the homologous and heterologous ha1 tests were tested in the iem tests, with the exceptions shown in table 2 . the results were essentially the same as in the ha1 tests: a two-way cross-reaction between both viruses was demonstrated in these iem tests with the sera which were also this specific anti-fpv serum (fig. 2) . in a dp dition the same serum-virus compositive in the ha1 test, while all presera failed to produce any aggregation (tab. 2, fig. 3 ). indirect if tests were performed in leighton tube mdck and crfk cell cultures, three days after infection with the third passage of cpv and fpv respectively, using the same serum-viral antigen combinations as used in the previous tests with the exceptions shown in table 2 . in homologous and heterologous systems a clear, predominantly nuclear, immunofluorescence was observed (fig. 4) in all combinations, which were also positive in ,the two previous tests. inclusion bodies could be shown to consist of accumulations of virus-specific antigen with these tests (fig. 4) . the negative combinations in the previous tests also proved to be negative in the corresponding if tests (tab. 2). minimal neutralization indices of sera used in the previous three tests were determined for cpv and fpv in leighton tube cultures, using the presence of intranuclear inclusion bodies in h e stained cultures as a criterion  in the present paper we describe the isolation in the netherlands of a virus from dogs with acute symptoms of diarrhea and with pathological lesions very similar to those of feline panleukopenia. a close antigenic relationship between this virus and fpv, a parvovirus of the cat, could be demonstrated. on the basis of this relationship, size and morphology of the particles, resistance to chloroform and the nature of the cytopathic changes caused in cell cultures, cpv appears to be a parvovirus. using pre-and post-inoculation sera from an fpv-vaccinated and a non-vaccinated cat and also from nonvaccinated dogs, which were all experimentally infected with cpv, we were able to demonstrate a two-way cross-reactivity between cpv and fpv in hai, iem, if and s n tests. although cpv and fpv are closely related, they agglutinate a different spectrum of erythrocytes: cpv agglutinates agm, cat and swine erythrocytes at 4 oc and fpv only agglutinates swine probably also distinguish cpv from the previously isolated canine parvovirus mvc, which failed to show cross-reactivity with fpv in ha1 tests (15) . another difference between cpv and fpv may be the cell spectrum in which both viruses multiply: cpv did multiply in both mdck and crfk cells, although higher titers qf infectivity were found in the homologous system, whereas fpv could only be propagated in the latter (osterhaus, unpublished observations). however, this could be a matter of adaptation. a practical implication of the close antigenic relationship between cpv and fpv might be the protection of dogs from cpv infections by vaccination with fpv vaccines. apart from a mild leukopenia and teniperature rise disease symptoms resembling feline panleukopenia were absent in the non-vaccinated cat after experimental infection with cell culture propagated cpv. it is not unlikely that environmental conditions and secondary bacterial infections may be im ortant in the pathogenesis as was shown for feline panleukopenia (13). d i s is also suggested by the fact that the two dogs did not develop any overt clinical symptoms after experimental infection with cpv, although also in these animals virus multiplication was evidenced by seroconversion. however, the potential role played by this virus in the etiology of contagious diarrhea is suggested by various reports from all over the world, associating a similar virus with outbreaks of diarrhea in the dog. moreover, in a large number of fecal samples from dogs in the netherlands, screened during the last few years no parvovirus-like particles were observed (unpublished observations), whereas almost all stools collected from dogs involved in the outbreaks described above were positive. as in mink virus enteritis (for review see 15), a virus closely related to fpv seems to cause a canine viral enteritis. it is still an open question why infections with cpv occurred apparently suddenly in many parts of the worl'd. serological and clinical data from the netherlands, and also from the usa (4), suggest that infections date only from the last few years. parvovirus-like particles were demonstrated by negative contrast electron microscopy in feces of dogs involved in outbreaks of a contagious diarrhea in the netherlands. the virus was isolated in a continuous cell line in which it produced intranuclear inclusion bodies. it showed a close antigenic relationship with feline panleukopenia virus: a two-way cross-reaction was observed in hemagglutination inhibition, immune electron microscopy, immunofluorescence and serum neutralization tests. in faces von hunden in den niederlanden nachgewiesen. das virus wurde in einer permanenten

      ";  210000  in late 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) 1 infected more than 1000 people, mostly in china, hong kong, taiwan, and canada, and caused deaths due to the infection by a novel human coronavirus [1] [2] [3] . then the sequence of the complete genome of this novel human coronavirus, sars-associated coronavirus (sars-cov), was determined. it contained 29,727 nucleotides in length and 11 open reading frames, with a genome organization similar to that of other known coronaviruses, including two human coronaviruses, hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e. the phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparisons indicated that sars-cov was not closely related to any of the three previously known groups of characterized coronaviruses [4, 5] . the sars-cov main proteinase (33.8 kda), also called the 3c-like (3cl) proteinase, was essential for the life cycle of sars-cov, playing a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription functions through extensive proteolytic processing of two replicase polyproteins: pp1a (486 kda) and pp1ab (790 kda) [6, 7] . because of the control of the activities of the coronavirus replication complex and the availability of numerous inhibitors of other coronavirus proteinases and efficient expression, the 3cl proteinase was a preferred target for the task of discovering drugs against sars. hilgenfeldõs group determined the crystal structures of human coronavirus (strain 229e) main proteinase and a substrate analogue hexapeptidyl chloromethyl ketone (cmk) inhibitor complex of porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, tgev) main proteinase. the results revealed a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate-binding site, and a homology model for sars-cov main proteinase was constructed [6] . the crystal structures of the sars-cov main proteinase at different ph values and binding to a specific inhibitor with a covalent-bonded substrate analogue were reported by raoõs group, providing insights to the substrate binding site and a structural basis for rational drug design [7] . the virtual screening tested by xiong et al. [8] indicated that 73 available proteinase inhibitors in the mddr database might dock into both the binding pockets of the tgev main proteinase and the sars-cov 3cl proteinase. a series of cell-based assays with sars virus and vero e6 cells, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry assays, were applied and reported by wu et al. [9] to screen existing drugs, natural products, and synthetic compounds to identify effective anti-sars agents, with the results showing that approximately 50 compounds were active at 10 lm and that 7 compounds were active at 3 lm. based on the atomic coordinates of the sars-cov main proteinase, research was conducted by chouõs group on kz7088 (a derivative of ag7088) and the avlqsgfr octapeptide to the enzyme, which were interacting with the active site of the sars enzyme through six hydrogen bonds, with kz7088 having a clear definition of the binding pocket [10] . kuo et al. [11] prepared a peptide with fluorescence quenching pair (dabcyl and edans) at both ends of a peptide substrate and used this fluorogenic peptide substrate to characterize the sars main proteinase and screen inhibitors. capillary electrophoresis (ce) may offer several advantages to the study of the interactions between small ligands and biomacromolecules, including small sample consumption (nanogram), short analysis time, ease of automation, high efficiency, and high resolving power [12] [13] [14] . one company, cetek, has developed and optimized the ce assay, an advanced ce assay for high information binding [15, 16] . the weak bindings (k b = 10 3 -10 4 m à1 ) of macromolecules and small ligands can be detected easily by affinity capillary electrophoresis (ace). another advantage of the ace method is that all of the interacting components can be studied in solution, thereby eliminating the possibility of denaturation of conformational alteration of the biomacromolecules such as protein and nucleic acid [12] . various affinity interactions, such as drug-protein, pro-tein-protein, protein-nucleic acid, protein-carbohydrate, peptide-antibiotic, enzyme-cofactors, lectinsugar, antigen-antibody, and cyclodextrins (cds)-enantiomer, have been investigated by ace during recent years [17, 18] . we demonstrated previously that the dimer of sars 3cl proteinase should be the biologically functional form and play a major role in catalysis [19] . inhibitors targeting the dimeric interface should be a new strategy to control the activity of sars 3cl proteinase. because one monomer of sars 3cl proteinase binds to the other, specifically at the n-terminal interface [6, 7] , to compete with the dimeric interaction of the proteinase, an octapeptide interface inhibitor was designed according to the amino acid sequence of the n terminus of sars 3cl proteinase. in the current study, a simple and effective ce method with very low sample consumption was developed and applied to study the interaction between sars 3cl proteinase and the octapeptide interface inhibitor. the binding constants were measured by the changes in the migration time of the octapeptide inhibitor at different concentrations of sars 3cl proteinase in the running buffer solutions. the octapeptide was found to bind to sars 3cl proteinase specifically and competitively. thermodynamic analysis indicates that hydrophobic interactions play a major role, along with electrostatic force, in the binding processes. sars 3cl proteinase was expressed in escherichia coli and purified according to published procedures [17] . the octapeptide (ser-gly-phe-arg-lys-met-ala-phe) was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl/tert-butyl strategy and was purified by reverse-phased hplc. bovine serum albumin (bsa, mw = 67,000) and ovalbumin (ova, mw = 43,000) were purchased from fluka. all other reagents were of analytical grade without further purification. deionized water was used throughout. apparatus ce was performed with the beckman p/ace 5000 system (fullerton, ca, usa). the uncoated fused silica capillary (beckman, 57 cm · 50 lm i.d., 50 cm to the detector) was used. the capillary chamber temperature (± 0.1°c) was controlled by forced liquid cooling. a run voltage of 15 kv in the normal polarity mode was applied. uv detection was performed at 214 nm. the gs-15r multipurpose refrigerated centrifuge (beckman) was applied to clear any trapped air bubbles in the running buffer solutions containing sars 3cl proteinase before use. the concentrations of sars 3cl proteinase stock solution were determined from uv absorbance at 280 nm (concentration/mg ml à1 = a 280 · 1.04). the stock solutions of octapeptide, bsa, and ova were prepared by accurately weighing defined amounts of the compounds, dissolving them in a defined volume of deionized water, and then storing at 4°c. the running buffer in the ce experiments was 25 mm sodium phosphate (ph 7.4). the investigated octapeptide and sars 3cl proteinase solutions in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) were prepared by diluting the defined volume of the stock solutions to the constant volume with buffer solution. the constant concentration of octapeptide in the sample was 1.50 · 10 à4 m. dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) served as an electroosmotic flow (eof) marker and was added to the sample at a concentration of 0.01% (v/v), which proved to have no influence on sars 3cl proteinase with the concentration less than 5% (v/v). the varying concentrations of sars 3cl proteinase in the running buffer were prepared from 0 to 10 lm. all solutions and deionized water were stored at 4°c, being filtered through 0.22-lm cellulose acetate membrane filters (shanghai xingya resin, shanghai, china) and sonicated for 10 min to remove air from solution prior to use. sars 3cl proteinase solutions were centrifuged for 5 min with 12,000 rpm at 4°c to exclude air from solutions before use. new capillary was conditioned for 60 min with 0.2 m naoh, for 30 min with water, and for 10 min with running buffer. between measurements, the capillary was flushed for 3 min with 0.2 m naoh, for 2 min with water, and for 2 min with running buffer. the sample containing octapeptide and dmso was introduced into the capillary by high-pressure injection (15 psi for 10 s). the electrophoresis was carried out using phosphate buffer solutions containing different concentrations of sars 3cl proteinase (0-10 lm). all separations were in triplicate. relative standard deviations (rsds) of the migration times were calculated from a series of three experiments carried out with the same sample within 1 day. the binding constants (k b ) are the most fundamentally important parameters for biologically active mole-cules [12] [13] [14] . the principle of this method for the determination of binding constants is to exploit the changes in the migration time of the complexed sample in the background electrolyte containing the complexation agent. after adding sars 3cl proteinase to background solution (bgs), the octapeptide inhibitor can interact with the proteinase. the equilibrium represented by the following equations assumed that a 1:1 complex is formed: where op, 3clp, and op-3clp are the octapeptide, sars 3cl proteinase, and complex, respectively. k b is the binding constant for eq. (1). as pointed out by yang et al. [20] , the capacity factor k, which is used as an indicator to describe the relationship between retention time and mass distribution equilibrium in chromatography, can be used here to describe the migration behaviors of the active compounds in ce. moreover, the addition of sars 3cl proteinase in the bgs is applied as a pseudo-stationary phase. based on our previous work [21, 22] , the binding constant can be measured according to the following equation: where / is phase ratio, [op] s is the concentration of the octapeptide in stationary phase, and [op] m0 is the initial concentration of the octapeptide without the addition of sars 3cl proteinase in the mobile phase. as defined in chromatography, the capacity factor k is equal to (t à t 0 )/t 0 , where t and t 0 are the migration times of the sample and neutral marker, respectively. with the linear relationship of k versus the concentration of sars 3cl proteinase ([3clp]), the binding constant is calculated from the slope (a) and intercept (b): the weak interactions between several anti-hiv compounds with hiv transactivation-responsive (tar) rna and bsa were successfully studied simultaneously and by quickly using this method with the binding constants of 10 3 to 10 4 m à1 [21, 22] . to evaluate the pharmacological activity of inhibitor binding to sars 3cl proteinase in a physiological system or simulated physiological system, the phosphate buffer system of 25 mm at ph 7.4 was used for the binding study. the migration times of the octapeptide (t) and dmso (t 0 ) were measured in seven running buffer solutions containing different concentrations of sars 3cl proteinase (0-10 lm). the experimental data and rsd values are summarized in table 1 . the reproducibility of the migration times was very well based on the values of rsd less than 0.5%. a set of electropherograms of migration time shift of the octapeptide inhibitor versus sars 3cl proteinase concentration change is shown in fig. 1 . a plot of k versus the concentration of sars 3cl proteinase at two temperatures based on the table  1 data is shown in fig. 2 . the binding constants of the inhibitor with the proteinase were determined four times at two temperatures and calculated according to eq. (4), with the average values being 2.44 · 10 4 m à1 (rsd = 6.0%, n = 4) at 20°c and 2.11 · 10 4 m à1 (rsd = 15%, n = 4) at 37°c. the rsd value at 37°c was larger than that at 20°c due to the instability of the higher capillary temperature. we demonstrated previously that the dimer of sars 3cl proteinase should be the biologically functional form and plays a major role in catalysis. in addition, one monomer of sars 3cl proteinase binds to the other one specifically at the n-terminal interface [19, 23] . to compete with the dimeric interaction of the proteinase, the octapeptide inhibitor was designed according to the amino acid sequence of the n terminus of sars 3cl proteinase. because the concentrations of sars 3cl proteinase were less than 0.2 mg ml à1 in the current experimental conditions, the main form of the proteinase was thought to be monomer. the binding constant of the octapeptide with sars 3cl proteinase was measured to be 2.44 · 10 4 m à1 at 20°c, and the dissociation constant of the dimer of the proteinase was estimated to be 100 lm [19] ; thus, the octapeptide inhibitor can bind to the monomer of the proteinase competitively and can prevent the dimerization effectively. moreover, the interactions between the octapeptide and the two common proteins, bsa and ova, were studied as a negative control at the same conditions to avoid the influence of nonspecific absorption. compared with fig. 2 , the plots of bsa were similar (fig. 3a) , with the binding constants being calculated as 8.01 · 10 3 m à1 at 20°c and 8.20 · 10 3 m à1 at 37°c, whereas the plots of ova were random (fig. 3b) . the results showed that the octapeptide could interact with bsa weakly but could not bind to ova and that there should be a specific binding between the octapeptide inhibitor and sars 3cl proteinase. small molecules bind to macromolecules with four types of interactions: h-bond, van der waals, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions. the thermodynamic parameters, enthalpy change (dh) and entropy change (ds) of the binding process, are important for confirming binding mode [24, 25] . if dh does not vary significantly over the temperature range studied, the enthalpic contribution to the gibbs free energy (dg) can be determined according to the following equation:  where k 1 and k 2 are the binding constants at temperatures t 1 and t 2 , respectively, and r is the gas constant (8.314 j mol à1 k à1 ). the free energy change is estimated from the following relationship: where k is the binding constant at the corresponding temperature. the entropy change can be determined from the following equation: based on the values of binding constants, the thermodynamic parameters dh, dg, and ds were measured according to eqs. (5)- (7), respectively. these values are summarized in table 2 . as shown in table 2 , dh values were negative under the experimental conditions, demonstrating that the binding reaction was an exothermic process. the sign and magnitude of the thermodynamic parameters associated with various kinds of interaction were characterized [24, 25] . from the point of view of water structure, positive entropy was frequently taken as the evidence of hydrophobic interaction, and it was also shown that positive entropy and slightly negative enthalpy might be a manifestation of electrostatic interactions between ionic species in aqueous solution [25] . based on the experimental data, we conclude that the hydrophobic interaction may play a major role, whereas electrostatic forces also contribute to the binding process of sars 3cl proteinase and the octapeptide inhibitor, consistent with our previous work. sars therapy requires the development of antiviral compounds that effectively prevent or treat this disease. a simple and reliable ce method with very low sample consumption was applied to study the interaction between sars 3cl proteinase and an octapeptide interface inhibitor. the binding constant was determined by the changes in the migration time of the octapeptide inhibitor at different concentrations of sars 3cl proteinase in the running buffers. the octapeptide was shown to bind to sars 3cl proteinase competitively, with binding constant k b values of 2.44 · 10 4 m à1 at 20°c and 2.11 · 10 4 m à1 at 37°c. analysis of the thermodynamic parameters, enthalpy change (dh) and entropy change (ds), indicated that hydrophobic interaction might play a major role, along with electrostatic force, in the binding processes. the ace method should be widely applicable for large-scale ligand screening against protein targets.\n",

      ";  220000  middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) is a positive sense, single-stranded rna virus in the genus betacoronavirus. it is a zoonotic pathogen capable sheila ommeh, wei zhang, ali zohaib and jing chen these authors have contributed equally to this work. of causing severe respiratory disease in humans. dromedary camels are considered as a source of zoonotic origin and natural reservoir host for mers-cov (azhar et al. 2014; haagmans et al. 2014) . as of september 20, 2018, mers-cov infection has been reported from 27 countries with 2249 laboratory-confirmed cases in humans and at least 798 related deaths (who 2018) . most of these cases occurred in the kingdom of saudi arabia, where the high prevalence of mers-cov in dromedary camels and direct contact with infected camels have been linked to human infections (haagmans et al. 2014; azhar et al. 2014) . notably, most human cases outside of the arabian peninsula have been linked to travel from saudi arabia. numerous surveillance studies in africa have revealed the presence of mers-cov antibodies in dromedaries from several african countries including nigeria, egypt, and mali (chu et al. 2014; chu et al. 2018; chu et al. 2015; falzarano et al. 2017) , where camels are reared and people frequently travel for pilgrimage to saudi arabia. similarly, in kenya, previous studies reported a high seroprevalence of mers-cov antibodies in archived dromedaries samples collected in 1992-2013 (corman et al. 2014) , and serological infection of mers-cov was confirmed in two people sampled from tana river county in 2013-2014 (liljander et al. 2016) . however, a recent study reported no evidence of mers-cov infection among camel farmers (munyua et al. 2017) . other recent studies suggested that the high densities of camel populations may be correlated with increased seropositivity and may contribute to long-term maintenance of the virus in the camel population. in this study, we evaluated the exposure of camels and humans to mers-cov in all camel-rearing counties in kenya as part of a country-wide surveillance program. this cross-sectional study was carried out from january 2016 to june 2018 across 13 counties in kenya where camels are reared (table 1 and fig. 1 ). the four camel breed types in kenya sampled in this study were from historical and recent camel rearing tribes (mburu et al. 2003) . therefore, based on the geographical division of breed types, the 13 counties were grouped into five groups. for human sampling, high-risk groups such as camel herders and their immediate families were targeted. sampling mainly focused on high-risk locations such as around watering points and common browsing locations that attract several herds of camels from different regions. for camel sampling, camel owners were informed about the study in a language that they understood. the camels were physically restrained, and 10 ml of blood from the jugular vein was drawn into anti-coagulant vacuum blood collection tubes. additionally, 1163 nasal swabs samples were collected in rnalater ò (ambion, foster city, ca, usa) and virus transport medium. the research was conducted in accordance with the helsinki declaration for sampling of human subjects. informed consent was obtained from camel owners, handlers, and family members or their guardians (in case of underage children) from whom blood was collected. five milliliters of blood from consenting study participants were collected by a clinician or phlebotomist from a peripheral vein into an anti-coagulant vacuum blood collection tube. sociodemographic data were also collected from the participants (supplemental table s2 ). other data such as age and sex were also collected. blood samples were centrifuged, plasma was aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen while in the field, and the samples were transported to nairobi for storage at -80°c. a total of 1,163 dromedary camels were sampled from 13 counties and 486 human subjects from 10 counties. camel and human samples were exported to wuhan institute of virology, chinese academy of science in hubei, peoples republic of china. all samples were transported according to iata international regulations for transporting viable samples. an in-house anti-mers-cov igg elisa kit was developed based on the purified spike protein receptor binding domain. this highly sensitive and specific elisa was previously validated for use with samples from camel and human (zohaib et al. 2018  a microneutralization assay was performed as described previously (perera et al. 2013) . briefly, vero b4 cells were seeded into 96-well plates. plasma samples were incubated at 56°c for 1 h. mers-cov (emc strain) was diluted with dmem to 100 tcid50/50 ll. the plasma samples were diluted by twofold in dmem and incubated with mers-cov at 37°c for 30 min. the medium was removed from the cells and 50 ll virus-plasma mixture was added. the virus-plasma mixture was removed after 1 h and 100 ll dmem plus 2% fetal bovine serum (fbs) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin was added. the cells were incubated at 37°c with 5% co 2 , and the cytopathic effect (cpe) was observed and recorded at 4 days post-infection. samples that inhibited cpe at a dilution of 1:20 were considered as positive. viral rna was extracted from camel nasal swabs stored in rnalater ò (ambion) using a viral rna extraction kit (roche, basel, switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. all camel nasal swabs were screened for mers-cov using two independent taqman quantitative reverse transcription pcr assays for the nucleocapsid gene (n) according to the who testing algorithm as described previously (lu et al. 2014) . additionally, camel samples positive according to rt-qpcr were also screened by mers-cov-specific rt-pcr targeting the n gene to confirm the presence of mers-cov in the samples as described previously (corman et al. 2012 ). virus isolation from two positive nasal swabs with high viral loads was attempted using vero cells. vero cell monolayers were maintained in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs. nasal swab specimens in viral transport medium were diluted in dmem before being added to the vero cells. after incubation at 37°c for 1.5 h, the inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh dmem containing 2% fbs and antibiotics. the cells were incubated at 37°c for 5 days and observed daily for cpes. the culture supernatant and cells were examined for the presence of virus by the rt-qpcr n2 assay targeting the mers-cov n gene (corman et al. 2012) and immunofluorescence assay using a rabbit antibody (prepared in house) against the mers-cov n protein. libraries for next-generation sequencing were prepared using an illumina truseq mrna kit (truseq stranded mrna library prep kit, cat #rs-122-2101, illumina, san diego, ca, usa) following the manufacturer's instructions. the sequencing was performed on a hiseq 3000 sequencer. the data obtained was analyzed in metavisitor (a suite of galaxy tools) as described previously (carissimo et al. 2017) . the blast-guided scaffold was then used to reference align the reads in geneious r11. phylogenetic analysis was performed in mega7. for mers-cov samples that were not selected for full-genome sequencing, specific rt-pcrs were set-up to amplify the partial s gene and fragment covering the gene regions of orf3, orf4a, and orf4b as described previously (smits et al. 2015; chu et al. 2018 ). elisa-positive samples were statistically analyzed (chi square test) to detect associations between location, age, and sex. univariable analysis was performed and odds ratios along with their 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated. a p value \\ 0.05 was considered as significant in all analyses. statistical analysis was performed in r  a total of 486 human plasma samples were collected from 10 counties in kenya from march 2017 to june 2018, among which 231 (48.63%) subjects were male and 244 (51.37%) were female; gender data for 11 human samples were missing. among the humans sampled, 95.27% stated that they have had close contact with livestock including camels. three hundred people in this group stated they have regular contact with camels as herdsmen. twenty of the 486 human plasma samples showed positive results by elisa. of these, eight were from west pokot, five were from tana river, four were from garissa, two were from wajir, and one was from isiolo counties. ten seropositive samples were male and nine were female, gender data of one elisa reactive sample was missing. twelve of the 20 elisa-positive individuals were in frequent contact with camels. a micro-neutralization test was performed on all elisa-reactive samples and none were positive in the neutralization assay. eleven camel nasal swabs (table 2) were positive for both n2 and n3 by rt-qpcr and nested pcr for the n gene. among them, five were from adult camels, four were from juvenile camels, and one was a sub-adult camel. age data for one positive camel was not available. high viral loads were observed in juvenile camels compared to in adults. sequencing of the pcr-positive n gene samples revealed 100% identical sequences. contamination was ruled out by repeating the experiments in independent laboratories and targeted pcr amplification and sequencing of the n gene. to allow for greater resolution of the viruses of interest, the long branch of kc869678 was removed. detected mers-cov viruses in this study are red colored and identified with circle node markers (d). scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. we partially sequenced the s gene of eight samples as described previously (table 2 ) (smits et al. 2015) . of these eight, six samples were 100% identical, whereas the other two samples showed one nucleotide difference compared to the other six positive samples. all mers-cov isolates from kenya clusters within sub-clade c2, which is associated with the african clade (data not shown). of the 11 samples detected in this study, two specimens with a high viral load were selected for virus isolation and full-length sequencing. cytopathic changes in vero cells were observed sequentially for 5 days post-infection ( fig. 2a) . camel mers-cov isolates in vero cells were confirmed by immunofluorescence assay (fig. 2b) and rt-qpcr (data not shown). genetic nucleotide identity was 100% between two kenyan viruses and 99.63%-99.77% for viruses from sub-clade c2 (fig. 3) , [ 99.14% within camel and human mers-cov from the middle east, and 97.82%-98.10% for viruses from sub-clade c1. full-length sequencing was also performed on rnalater ò preserved nasal swab samples. no nucleic acid differences were detected between isolated viruses and rnalater ò preserved samples. the results of phylogenetic analysis of kenyan mers-cov sequences along with other relevant viruses are shown in fig. 3 . the tree was rooted against a mers-cov-related bat coronavirus from south africa (kc869678.4). viruses from kenya clustered together with sequences from ethiopia, egypt, burkina faso, nigeria, and morocco in clade c. within clade c, viruses from kenya clustered with viruses from ethiopia and egypt in sub-clade c2. characteristics signature deletions in orf4b have been observed in viruses from africa in sub-clade c1 but not in those from egypt and sub-clade c2. notably, ethiopian and egyptian mers-cov encode full-length orf4b (246 amino acids). two viruses detected in this study were unique because they had a truncated orf4b (244aa) in sub-clade c2 (fig. 4) , whereas the other three sequences encoded full-length orf4b of 246 amino acids. previously, a deletion pattern in the orf3 region of african mers-cov has also been reported (chu et al. 2018) . however, mers-cov from kenya encodes full-length orf3. the amino acid residues of kenyan sample c1215 differed from the emc strain throughout the virus genome. the amino acid residues in the spike protein receptor binding domain of c1215 contained the amino acid substitutions s10f and s148p in the receptor binding motif. although these two mutations were observed in the spike receptor binding domain region of mers-cov, the camel plasma and human plasma were effectively neutralized by the emc strain from kenya as described previously; thus these mutations likely do not affect the affinity of the protein for the host receptor (corman et al. 2014; liljander et al. 2016) , although further studies are needed to confirm this.  previous studies have reported the prevalence of mers-cov antibodies in archived samples (corman et al. 2014; liljander et al. 2016; munyua et al. 2017) . this is the first study to report the detection and characterization of mers-cov from kenyan dromedaries. the nucleic acid sequences determined in this study confirm the genetic uniqueness of the african clade of this virus compared to those reported in the arabian peninsula (chu et al. 2018) . the observed genetic relationship between mers-cov sequences in kenya and those detected in camels from ethiopia are likely related to strong geographical affinities. a recent study characterized mers-cov from africa, which exhibited region-dependent genetic diversity (chu et al. 2018 ). however, the study did not describe mers-cov from kenya. in the current study, we found that mers-cov from kenya is phylogenetically distinct (clade c) from viruses in the arabian peninsula. additionally, although truncation of orf4b was observed in kenyan viruses, these viruses lacked the signature deletion patterns of orf4b observed previously in western african mers-cov in sub-clade c1. previous studies focused on genetic and phenotypic characterization of mers-cov from west africa; however, studies of eastern african mers-cov utilizing one-health approaches are urgently needed. this study further confirms the widespread presence of mers-cov among camels in all camel-rearing counties in kenya. although the seroprevalence varied between counties in kenya, the widespread occurrence indicates the need for a national-wide strategy for early detection and prevention rather than county-based approaches. the seroprevalence rates observed in this study are consistent with those obtained in previous studies in kenya and other african countries. of the 13 counties evaluated in this study, the highest seropositivity was observed in marsabit county (87.34%), which is comparable to that reported in a recent study of archived plasma of marsabit county camels in 2013. eleven camels were positive for mers-cov nucleic acids in different counties, indicating the active circulation of mers-cov in kenya, which was confirmed by the presence of mers-cov antibodies in juvenile/young camels in all geographic regions except for in region e. this agrees with the results of previous studies which suggested that younger camels are most likely to be infected by mers-cov (sabir et al. 2016) . the presence of a high viral load in juvenile camels also suggests that younger camels play a key role in the maintenance and spread of mers-cov. we were not able to sample an equal proportion of males and females mainly because of camel husbandry practices which value female camels, which produce milk, over males. our study focused on high-risk groups i.e. humans that frequently interact with camels as well as infection hot spots such as common watering points and browsing locations. most herders prefer moving camels in several groups for feeding and watering as a form of security. additionally, watering points are frequented by different types of livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats. humans and wildlife also utilize these water sources, as these counties are in either arid or semi-arid regions where water is a scarce resource. as previously reported, we were not able to detect neutralizing antibodies from sampled humans even though some of them were elisa positive (munyua et al. 2017) . we predict that mers-cov in kenyan camels has low pathogenicity in humans, and neutralization antibody levels either decreased quickly or were undetectable in the neutralization assay; second, other coronaviruses are closely related to mers-cov but distinct at the virus neutralization epitopes. additional studies focusing on surveillance in human, other wildlife species, and camels are needed to determine the prevalence of mers-cov in the general kenyan population and identify the risk factors of infection. department of livestock, ministry of agriculture livestock and fisheries of kenya, county veterinary departments, and study area chiefs. this study was approved by the kenyatta national hospital/ university of nairobi ethics and research committee for conducting research on human subjects under permit reference number p210/04/ 2017. informed consent was obtained from camel owners, handlers, and family members or their guardians (in case of underage children) from whom blood was collected. all institutional and national guidelines for care and

      ";  230000  a cluster outbreak of pneumonia now known as the novel coronavirus infectious disease occurred in wuhan city, hubei province of china, beginning in december 2019 (lu, et al. 2020) . the who has named the pneumonia caused by this coronavirus coronavirus disease 2019 and declared covid-19 as a global health emergency. (commission 2019 , lu, et al. 2020 . as of june 2nd, 2020, there are more than 6,430,000 patients confirmed to have covid-19 and 385,000 deaths worldwide. nearly 14% of the patients need icu management because of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) (wu and mcgoogan 2020) . ct (computerized tomography) scan is the key imaging modality for these patients (chung, et al. 2020 , pan, et al. 2020 . however, the disadvantages of a ct scan include the need to transport the patient to the ct room, radiation exposure and, most importantly, the risk of virus dissemination. as a result, lung ultrasound seems to be a safer and more convenient alternative to ct scans in a transportation-limited setting such as when mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) are needed. in an urgent situation when a patient's situation deteriorates, a rapid imaging tool is urgently needed. lung ultrasound has evolved in recent decades, especially in critical care and emergency management. studies of lung ultrasound have proven the value of this imaging modality in identifying pulmonary diseases including pulmonary edema and pneumonia, especially in the emergency and intensive care settings (lichtenstein and meziere 2008, lichtenstein 2009 ). we have introduced bedside ultrasound for the imaging assessment of patients with severe covid-19 to evaluate the severity of pneumonia. (1) severe type: respiratory distress with a respiratory rate ≥ 30 times/min and an oxygen saturation≤93% and a pao2/fio2 ≤ 300 mmhg in a resting state; (2) critical type: respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock and other organ failure requiring icu monitoring and treatment; (3) refractory type: refractory respiratory failure with a pao2/fio2≤100 mmhg or patients who were treated with ecmo. we included patients with refractory-type disease in the refractory group and those with severe-type and critical-type disease in the nonrefractory group. the lung ultrasound features and scores were studied and compared between the two groups. lung ultrasound assessment: all ultrasound evaluations were performed at the bedside by three physicians with over 5 years of critical care experience. operators were dressed in protective clothing, gloves and goggles to enter the isolation ward. all precautions for respiratory, droplet and contact isolation were provided in this ward. the ultrasound probe was placed in a sterile plastic sleeve or sterile glove. the operator used a convex probe to perform an ultrasound of the lungs. pulmonary ultrasound was screened first longitudinally and then transversely according to blue protocol (lichtenstein 2009 ). the longitudinal examination began by finding the sonogram of the ribs and the pleural line between the two ribs to identify the lung tissue. a transverse examination was then performed to further clarify the images of the lungs. image data were frozen and saved after obtaining the desired image, and the patient's name and examination location were marked. at the end of the procedure, we sterilize the probe in a dedicated area and placed the sterile plastic bag or sterile gloves in a medical recycling bag. all images were reviewed and scored by two physicians with over 5 years of critical care ultrasound experience with the operator. an m7 expert ultrasound system with a 5-mhz curved (c60x) transducer was used for lung ultrasound assessment (mindray investment co, ltd, china). we examined each side of the chest wall in 5 examination zones: the anterosuperior and anteroinferior zones were the second and fifth intercostal space in the midclavicular line; the laterosuperior and lateroinferior zones were the same cross-sections at the midaxillary line; and the posterior zone was the subscapularis area on the back. in total, 10 zones were examined on every patient's chest wall. patients were investigated in a semirecumbent or supine position. we focused on the following patterns, and a numeric value was assigned according to the most severe finding: (1) 0 points, normal pattern with a smooth and sliding pleural line with parallel a-lines; (2) 1 point, b-line patterns: b-lines were defined as discrete laser-like vertical hyperechoic artifacts arising from the pleural line and extending to the bottom of the image without fading (lichtenstein, et al. 1997 ); (3) 2 points, ground-glass sign with b-lines occupying the entire screen; (3) 3 points, shred sign that was fragmented similar to small consolidation under the pleural line; (4) 4 points, liver tissue-like consolidation sign; and (4) 4 points, pleural effusion. for one patient, the sum of the 10 zone numbers was recorded as the lus score, which ranged from 0 to 40. the affected zones of each pattern were also recorded. this scoring system referenced some previously published scoring systems (bouhemad, et al. 2011 , soldati, et al. 2020 , volpicelli, et al. 2020 ). we compared the demographical and lus data between the nonrefractory group and the refractory group. statistical analysis was performed with rstudio 1.2.1335 (rstudio, inc., boston, ma, usa). normally distributed data are expressed as the mean (sd) and were analyzed by student's t-test. nonnormally distributed data are expressed as the median (interquartile range [iqr] ) and were analyzed by the wilcoxon test. proportions are expressed as numbers (percentages) and were compared by the chi-square test or fisher's exact test. linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between lus and pao2/fio2. receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves were plotted to illustrate the accuracy in recognizing patients with refractory pneumonia. a total of 35 patients were enrolled in this study. in total, 28 patients were in the nonrefractory group, and 7 were in the refractory group. as shown in table 1 , the mean age was not significantly different between the groups. in the nonrefractory group, there were 8 patients on mechanical ventilation, and 20 on hfnc. in the refractory group, all 7 patients were on ecmo in the end. in total, there were 15 patients who were mechanically ventilated. there were 7 patients from wuhan and 5 patients who had traveled to wuhan within 14 days (table 1) . ultrasound morphology features and their distributions are shown in table 2 . the b-line pattern ( fig 1b) and shred sign ( fig 1d) were the most typical ultrasound features that were frequently found in both groups. the median number of zones that showed a shred sign was 6 [iqr 6-7] in the refractory group and 8 [iqr 7-9] in the nonrefractory group. patients in the refractory group showed less b-line patterns than those in the nonrefractory group (4 [iqr 2-7] vs 6 [iqr 6-7], p = 0.046). the ground-glass pattern ( fig 1c) occurred significantly more frequently in the refractory group than in the nonrefractory group (6 [iqr 2.5-6.5] vs 0 [iqr 0-3]). although the consolidation pattern ( fig 1e) was not that frequently found in both groups, it seemed that the refractory group had significantly more consolidation patterns. for the effusion pattern (fig 1f) , there were significantly more patients with this pattern in the refractory group than in the nonrefractory group (5 [iqr 1.5-6] vs 0 [iqr 0-0.25]). the refractory group showed a higher lus score than the nonrefractory group ( fig 2 a) . in different scanning zones, the refractory group always have a higher lus score (fig 2 b) . the scores in the nonrefractory group were equal between zones. in the refractory group, the scores were higher in the gravity-dependent zones. however, wilcoxon analysis found no significant difference between zones in patients with refractory disease. when lus was utilized in distinguishing patients with refractory disease, the cutoff point was 32 points (fig 3a) . at this point, predicting a refractory situation had a specificity of 0.893 and a sensitivity of 0.571. the roc curve of the pao2/fio2 is also shown in fig 3, and the cutoff point is 114 , with a specificity of 0.74 and a sensitivity of 100%. the auc of the pao2/fio2 roc was 0.894. however, lus did not differentiate well between the two severe and critical groups of patients, with an auc of only 0.52 (fig 3b) . covid-19 has already involved nearly 6,430,000 people all over the world. although ct is the most important imaging modality for viral pneumonia, the high risk of transporting ventilated patients or patients on ecmo with hemodynamic failure makes ct have limited availability. furthermore, the risk of the contagiousness of the coronavirus should be evaluated before transportation. in addition, in the icu, protective clothing makes stethoscopes have limited utility. `lung ultrasound has significantly evolved in the critical care and emergency department due to its theoretical and practical aspects. we introduced ultrasound for the examination of covid-19 lesions because in critical care, ultrasound is an optimal tool for patients on mechanical ventilation or ecmo. both convex and linear probes can be used for ultrasound of the lungs (radzina and biederer 2019 , soldati, et al. 2019 . however, because the convex probe may be more suitable for obese patients, it can also be used for abdominal and even cardiac examinations; thus, a convex probe was used in this study instead of a linear probe. both bounsenso and soldati have suggested that wireless probes and tablets represent the most appropriate ultrasound equipment , soldati, et al. 2020 ). these devices can easily be wrapped in single use plastic covers to reduce the risk of contamination and allow simple sterilization procedures. however, the unavailability of these devices limited our choice. daily assessment of the lungs can provide an assessment of the severity of lung disease since patients with refractory disease have more decreased lung aeration that can be evaluated by the lung ultrasound score. the lus could differentiate between the two groups when they were divided into refractory and nonrefractory groups (p = 0.047). we haven't divided the patients into three groups (the severe group, the critical group and the refractory group) because the lung ultrasound score (lus) could not differentiate well between the severe group and the critical group (p = 0.18). more ground-glass patterns and pleural effusions may indicate a more critical status. ground-glass sign indicates a high ratio of fluid to air. this pattern was more frequently found in the refractory group. previous ct studies have found few effusions (chung, et al. 2020 , fang, et al. 2020 , pan, et al. 2020 . however, in the current study, more pleural effusions may have been related to refractory respiratory failure. the reason may be that patients with refractory disease in this study had more severe disease or were in progressed stages, and mechanical ventilation may have further injured the lungs of these patients. when the density of the lung increases to that of solid tissue, consolidation appears. although there were more consolidation patterns in the refractory group, consolidation patterns were not so frequently found in either groups. previous ct studies have also found few consolidation patterns (chung, et al. 2020 , fang, et al. 2020 , pan, et al. 2020 ). the shred sign and b-line patterns were the most typical ultrasound features but were not specific to distinguish patients with refractory disease because we found many b-lines and shred signs in both groups. previous literature regarding ct scan disclosed that covid-19 lesions are always distributed at the peripheral part of the lungs (pan, et al. 2020 ). this characteristic is beneficial for lung ultrasound to detect small fragments such as the shred sign in the shallow part of the lungs. the b-line pattern is considered to be highly reliable in diagnosing interstitial lesions and viral etiologies (lichtenstein, et al. 1997 , cortellaro, et al. 2012 ) such as h1n1 and h7n9 (testa, et al. 2012 , tsai, et al. 2014 ). however, this pattern is not related to a more critical status in covid-19 patients. the reason may be that the number of b-lines was not described and analyzed in detail in this study. the lung ultrasound score exhibits a high specificity of 89.4% in distinguishing refractory respiratory failure in covid-19 patients. although the auc of the lus is lower than that of the pao2/fio2, the lus exerts a much higher specificity than the pao2/fio2. if we combined the high specificity of the lus and the high sensitivity of the pao2/fio2, we may have a much more reliable diagnosis. while one patient had a pao2/fio2 lower than 114, we had a 100% sensitivity in distinguishing patients with refractory disease. a further lus assessment of more than 32 points on the lus can improve the specificity to nearly 90%. thus, we can have a more accurate model to differentiate refractory respiratory failure among patients who might need urgent life-saving maneuvers such as ecmo. ecmo was recommended by the who interim guidelines for eligible covid-19 patients who had developed refractory ards (ramanathan, et al. 2020) . available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ards who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ecmo. in this study, the patients in the refractory group were all put on venovenous ecmo, and the lung ultrasound score exhibited a high specificity of 89.4% in distinguishing refractory respiratory failure in covid-19 patients. a previous study disclosed that lung ultrasound is a valuable tool for bedside assessment of lung aeration in subjects supported by ecmo (lu, et al. 2019) . however, such a practice has not been reported in covid-19 patients. based on ultrasound findings, we have utilized lung ultrasound in the following routine works: (1) daily assessment of the severity of lung lesions: b-lines gradually disappear and are replaced by a-lines, and consolidation that progressively disappears might indicate an improvement in the lungs, while more interstitial syndrome or more consolidation may indicate progression of the disease; (2) management of ecmo patients in put-on or weaning: an lus more than 32 might indicate a refractory status in this patient; namely, more interstitial syndrome and more consolidations detected by the lus are directly correlated with the severity of the lung injury, which may indicate the need for venovenous ecmo; (3) diagnosis of the reason for rapid deterioration among patients; and (4) reducing the need for ct scan. our study has limitations. first, this is a retrospective experience-based study with a small sample size; thus, the extrapolations of the conclusion may not be strong enough to be suitable for other critical covid-19 patients. second, the acoustic beam cannot reach the deeper part of the lungs, and ultrasound features are always indirect artifacts of the lesions. third, with ultrasound, some parts of the thorax cannot be screened, especially the back because patients with severe disease are always in the supine position. according to soldati's recommendation (soldati, et al. 2020) , all patients should have a lung ultrasound at 14 sites. however, 15 patients in this study were mechanically ventilated, and a good ultrasound examination of the back could not be obtained. therefore, we focused only on evaluating lung ultrasound in the lower back segment in all patients. there were 4 fewer sites examined than soldati's recommendation; thus, the patient score may have been underestimated. even though we used conservative fluid therapy for all of our patients, we were still not completely sure if the patient had fluid overload and congestive heart failure. these conditions might also influence the b-lines and the analysis of the lung ultrasound scores. in summary, covid-19 patients share common ultrasound patterns such as b-lines and shred signs. however, patients with refractory covid-19 have more ground-glass signs, consolidation patterns and pleural effusion. the lung ultrasound score can be utilized to distinguish critical patients who might need ecmo with a high specificity of 90%. ultrasound can be used as a routine tool for daily assessment of the lung aeration of severely critical covid-19 patients. the authors declare that they have no potential financial or ethical conflicts of interest regarding the contents of this manuscript. ultrasound score in the refractory group was higher than that in the nonrefractory group. b in most scanning zones, the lus was higher in the refractory group than in the non-ecmo group. in refractory group, grand glass pattern, consolidation pattern and pleural effusions were significantly more than in the non-refractory group.\n",

      ";  240000  the identification of glycosylation sites in proteins is often possible through a combination of proteolytic digestion, separation, mass spectrometry (ms) and tandem ms (ms/ms). liquid chromatography (lc) in combination with ms/ms has been a reliable method for detecting glycopeptides in digestion mixtures, and for assigning glycosylation sites and glycopeptide sequences. direct interfacing of lc with ms relies on electrospray ionization, which produces ions with two, three or four charges for most proteolytic peptides and glycopeptides. ms/ms spectra of such glycopeptide ions often lead to ambiguous interpretation if deconvolution to the singly charged level is not used. in contrast, the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) technique usually produces singly charged peptide and glycopeptide ions. these ions require an extended m/z range, as provided by the quadrupole-quadrupole time-of-flight (qqtof) instrument used in these experiments, but the main advantages of studying singly charged ions are the simplicity and consistency of the ms/ms spectra. a first aim of the present study is to develop methods to recognize and use glycopeptide [mþh] þ ions as precursors for ms/ms, and thus for glycopeptide/glycoprotein identification as part of wider proteomics studies. secondly, this article aims at demonstrating the usefulness of maldi-ms/ms spectra of n-glycopeptides. mixtures of diverse types of proteins, obtained commercially, were prepared and subjected to reduction, alkylation and tryptic digestion. micro-column reversed-phase separation allowed deposition of several fractions on maldi plates, followed by ms and ms/ms analysis of all peptides. glycopeptide fractions were identified after ms by their specific m/z spacing patterns (162, 203, 291 u) between glycoforms, and then analyzed by ms/ms. in most cases, ms/ms spectra of [mþh] þ ions of glycopeptides featured peaks useful for determining sugar composition, peptide sequence, and thus probable glycosylation site. peptide-related product ions could be used in database search procedures and allowed the identification of the glycoproteins. copyright high-throughput analysis in proteomics using mass spectrometry (ms), tandem ms (ms/ms) and database searching is possible even though several post-translational modifications are usually present in proteins from a given cell. acety-lation, phosphorylation and glycosylation, among other possibilities, do change the masses of peptides and thus it is often necessary or inevitable to omit modified proteolytic peptides from a search, and rather work with the remaining peptides. protein identification can be accomplished without knowledge about the types of modifications present, which is satisfactory at the early stages of characterization. it is important to characterize post-translational modifications when details are needed on specific proteins relevant to disease or other physiological variations, because they reflect the conditions of expression of the proteins. whether protein identification is based on de novo sequencing, sequence analogy or database matching, quick detection and characterization of post-translationally modified peptides are helpful because they avoid false peptide assignments based solely on mass and result in enhanced sequence coverage. to date, most analyses involving glycopeptide characterization by ms have been conducted using electrospray ionization (esi) with ms/ms. a useful approach developed by carr, huddleston et al. in 1993 1,2 consists of monitoring hexnac þ (m/z 204) or hex-hexnac þ (m/z 366) product ions during an on-line high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) esi-ms/ms experiment. also, more recently, ritchie et al. used precursor ion scans for ions of high m/z values rather than product ion scans to detect glycoforms of different n-glycopeptides by hplc/ms/ms. 3 further characterization of glycopeptides has been conducted by several research groups using ms/ms of doubly or triply charged precursor ions generated by esi. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] overall, product-ion spectra vary considerably depending on the type of mass spectrometer and on the conditions used. some ms/ms spectra of glycopeptides exhibit successive characteristic losses of monosaccharide units [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] and also show high abundance mono-and disaccharide ions at lower m/z values. [6] [7] [8] [9] other cases show, in addition to the sugarrelated ions mentioned above, peptide backbone fragments that can be used for sequencing. 4, 5 with esi-ms, the most useful information in terms of localization of glycosylation sites has been obtained by performing ms/ms on the [peptideþglcnac] þ ions obtained by in-source fragmentation of the corresponding glycopeptides, at high declustering voltage values. the resulting ms/ms spectra provided very unambiguous sequence information, plus assignment of the glycosylation site(s). 5, 7 whether by in-source fragmentation or collision-induced dissociation (cid) in a cell, [peptideþglcnac] þ or [peptideþglcnac] 2þ ions generated from glycopeptides are always abundant and constitute a good signature for these modified peptides. due to frequent esi formation of doubly, triply or quadruply charged glycopeptide precursor ions, deconvolution to the singly charged level is often useful to ease interpretation 4, 8 and would be a necessary step for automated detection or identification of glycopeptides among other mixture components. matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) ms generally produces [mþh] þ ions for peptides and glycopeptides, which makes preliminary assignments of peptide/ glycopeptide peaks more amenable than by esi-ms. reversephase lc separation followed by direct sample deposition on a multi-well maldi target 11, 12 greatly decreases the number of compounds per maldi spot. the proteomic analysis is then performed on many static samples rather than dynamically on-line, using an hplc system. glycopeptide-containing fractions are usually identified via the observation of singly charged glycoform peaks corresponding to the same peptide, i.e. spaced by 162 u (galactose, gal), 203 u (nacetylglucosamine, glcnac) or 291 u (n-acetylneuraminic or sialic acid, neunac) in the spectrum. 13 interestingly, ms/ms analysis of glycopeptide [mþh] þ ions generated by maldi in our laboratory led to consistent fragmentation patterns, 13 scheme 1) , the latter corre-sponding to a 0,2 x 0 cross-ring fragmentation of the connecting glcnac residue. 14 at m/z values lower than this quadruplet, y or b ions provided most of the peptide sequence information, and no abundant sugar-residue ions were present, as reported before in esi-ms/ms analyses of doubly or triply charged precursors. [6] [7] [8] [9] cid-ms/ms spectra of non-glycosylated peptides obtained under similar conditions using the maldi-quadrupole-quadrupole time-of-flight (qqtof) instrument 15 usually consist of y and b ions with no particular species displaying high or low abundances except for y fragments corresponding to cleavages at the asp c-terminal side in arg-terminated peptides. in contrast, for glycopeptides, the abundance of ions forming the group of four peaks discussed above is easily traceable and thus conducive to the recognition of glycopeptides. moreover for most glycopeptides analyzed, the ms/ms spectrum at and below the m/z value of the [peptideþh-17] þ ions resembled that of the peptide without any sugar, and could therefore be interpreted automatically using a sequencing algorithm. this routine led to database assignment of peptide identity within a protein, as if there had been no glycan attached to the peptide. recently, demelbauer et al. showed that a maldi-q-ion trap reflectron tof instrument (qit-rtof) could produce similar features when operated in the ms 2 mode. 16 in this article, a fast method for detection, identification and sequencing of n-glycopeptides is presented, based on ms and ms/ms measurements using a prototype maldi-qqtof instrument. 15 this method was developed and tested using a mixture of proteins and glycoproteins, all obtained commercially, which were reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin all together. peptides were then separated by scheme 1. fragmentation pattern observed in the ms/ms spectra of precursor ions of glycopeptides generated by maldi. the tryptic peptide chain is represented by a vertical dashed line. the first n-acetylglucosamine residue of a glycan attached to asparagine (asn) is shown, with corresponding fragment ions observed. micro-column reverse-phase hplc into several fractions, each of which was analyzed by maldi-ms and ms/ms. the aims of this study were to integrate glycopeptide precursor ion signals as part of wider range proteomics studies, 17, 18 and to use glycopeptide ms/ms fragments to determine peptide sequences, sugar contents, and glycosylation sites. proteins (unless otherwise noted), dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, trifluoroacetic acid (tfa), and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (dhb) were obtained from sigma chemicals (st. louis, mo, usa). sequencing-grade modified trypsin (promega, fitchburg center, wi, usa) was used for all digestion procedures. several commercially available proteins were digested using trypsin and then mixtures of the digests were prepared. proteins are listed here in alphabetical order: acylase (porcine), alcohol dehydrogenase (horse), alcohol dehydrogenase (yeast), aldolase (rabbit), alpha-lactalbumin (bovine), apoferritin (horse), apo-transferrin (bovine), apo-transferrin (human), asparaginase (e. coli), beta-galactosidase (e. coli), beta-lactoglobulin (bovine), carbonic anhydrase (bovine), carbonic anhydrase (human), catalase (bovine), chymotrypsinogen (bovine), citrate syntase (e. coli), conalbumin (chicken), concavalin (jack bean), creatinine kinase (rabbit), cytochrome c (horse), fetuin (bovine), fibronectin (human), fibrinogen (bovine), fibrinogen (human), fumarase (porcine), glucose oxidase (aspergillus niger), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (yeast), glutamate dehydrogenase (bovine), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (rabbit), glucoamylase (aspergillus niger), glucuronidase (e. coli), hexokinase (yeast), isocitric dehydrohenase (bovine), lactoferrin (bovine), lactoferrin (human), luciferase (fire fly), lysozyme (chicken), myoglobin (horse), ovalbumin (chicken), pepsinogen (porcine), peroxidase (horse radish), phosphorylase b (rabbit), protein a (staphylococcus aureus), protein disulfide isomerase (bovine), rennin (bovine), ribonuclease a (bovine), serum albumin (bovine), serum albumin (human), serum albumin (porcine), serum albumin (rat), serum albumin (sheep), streptavidin (streptomyces avidinii), superoxide dismutase (bovine), tropomyosin (bovine), and trypsin (porcine). these mixtures were first prepared for the study of chromatographic retention of tryptic peptides without preliminary consideration of possible glycosylation patterns. the same in-solution proteolytic digestion protocol was used in all experiments. proteins were reduced (10 mm dithiothreitol, 30 min, 578c), alkylated (50 mm iodoacetamide, 30 min in the dark at room temperature), dialyzed against 100 mm nh 4 hco 3 (6 h, 7 kda mwco, pierce), and digested overnight with (sequencing-grade) modified trypsin (promega, 1:50 enzyme/substrate weight ratio, 12 h, 378c). first, digests of each individual protein (1 mg/ml) were analyzed separately by maldi-ms to confirm protein identity. mixtures of these protein digests (0.4 pmol/ml of each protein) were prepared by appropriate dilution in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (tfa) aqueous solution. the mixture (5 ml, 2 pmol of each protein) was injected into the m-hplc system. in total five different mixtures were prepared, each containing 300-400 potential tryptic fragments in the 560-5000 u mass range. one example of application of site-specific n-glycosylation analysis presented here was of interest during the study of the glycosylation pattern of human a5b1 integrin. the integrin was affinity purified from placenta 19 and subjected to a peptide mapping study, as for all proteins listed above. deionized (18 m) water and hplc-grade acetonitrile were used for the preparation of eluents. column temperature was maintained at 308c throughout all experiments. chromatographic separations were performed using a micro-agilent 1100 series system (agilent technologies, wilmington, de, usa). samples (5 ml) were injected directly onto a 150 mm â 150 mm column (vydac 218 tp c18, 5 mm; grace vydac, hesperia, ca, usa) and eluted with a linear gradient of 1-80% acetonitrile (0.1% tfa) in 120 min or 0.66% acetonitrile/min at 4 ml/min flow rate. peek 65 mm i.d. and fusedsilica 50 mm i.d. tubings were used for pre-and post-column liquid connections. the column effluent (4 ml/min) was mixed on-line with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (dhb) mal-di matrix solution (0.5 ml/min), and deposited by a computer-controlled robot 12 onto a movable gold target at 0.5-min intervals. a microtee p775 (upchurch scientific) was used for on-line mixing in the micro-flow version. fractions (120) were collected, as most tryptic peptides were eluted within 60 min. fractions were air-dried and subjected to maldi-ms analysis. the identity of each of the digested proteins was confirmed by peptide mass fingerprinting. each protein digest was mixed 1:1 with matrix solution (150 mg/ml of dihydroxybenzoic acid in 1:1 water/acetonitrile), deposited on a goldplated maldi target, air-dried and subjected to maldi-ms analysis. the spots from each individual digest as well as the chromatographic fractions were analyzed by single mass spectrometry (ms) with m/z range 560-5000, and by tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) using the manitoba/sciex prototype quadrupole/tof (qqtof) mass spectrometer. 15 in this instrument, ions are produced by irradiation of the sample with photon pulses from a 20-hz nitrogen laser (vcl 337nd; spectra-physics, mountain view, ca, usa) with 300 mj energy per pulse. orthogonal injection of ions from the quadrupole into the tof section normally produces a mass resolving power of $10 000 fwhm, and accuracy within a few mu in the tof spectra in both ms and ms/ms modes. during low-energy cid ms/ms, positive ions exiting from the first quadrupole are accelerated by a drop in voltage before entering the collision cell. the extent of voltage drop depended on the m/z of the peptide considered, and was $50 v per 1000 u. because the maximum value of voltage drop is 160 v, large analytes could not be fragmented efficiently over the whole m/z range. thus, for precursor ions with m/z >3500 u, it was difficult to observe significant peptide fragmentation in ms/ms spectra of glycopeptides. 'm/z' and 'sonarms/ms' programs (manitoba centre for proteomics 20 ) were used for peak assignment and ms/ms identification of peptides, respectively. signal-to-noise ratios of 2.5 and 1.3 were used as criteria for peak assignment in ms and ms/ms spectra, respectively. 'sonarms/ms' requires an entry of the m/z value of the precursor ions. this value corresponds to the bare non-modified peptide and consequently is different from the actual m/z of the glycosylated species used for ion selection. tandem mass spectra were inspected manually for a characteristic signature pattern for glycopeptides, i.e. the quadruplet  the intent of this study was to demonstrate approaches to identifying and characterizing glycopeptides by maldi-ms in complex peptide mixtures, instead of omitting and discarding their precursor ion signals in global proteomics analyses. the aim was not to attempt identification of all glycopeptides in a mixture, but rather to use signals that were left unidentified in a proteomics search, 17, 18 and relate these to glycopeptides through signature maldi-ms and ms/ms patterns. a component of the research involved maldi-ms spectra derived from the analysis of hplc fractions containing many peptides and glycopeptides. under these conditions it was still possible, in some cases, to quickly detect glycoforms of peptides based on the characteristic patterns of peaks separated by 162 u (mannose, galactose), 203 u (n-acetylglucosamine) or 291 u (n-acetylneuraminic acid). they are also easy to distinguish from bare (non-modified) peptides by their high m/z values relative to those of coeluting peptides. reverse-phase hplc elutes unmodified peptides in order of increasing hydrophobicity. the elution order, to some extent, correlates with peptide molecular mass because larger peptides are more likely to contain more hydrophobic amino acids. therefore, early hplc fractions were enriched with low molecular mass species and, conversely, the later fractions contained an increased proportion of large peptides. the addition of glycans results in an accelerated elution rate, i.e. a glycopeptide has a shorter retention time, but higher mass, than its unmodified analog. typical mass spectra of hplc fractions therefore exhibit mostly non-glycosylated peptides at the lower m/z end, and glycopeptide ions at the higher end. the latter are somewhat isolated in the spectrum, and are thus easy to distinguish from unmodified peptide [mþh] þ ions. figure 1 shows two examples of such results in the higher m/z sections of spectra for high-mannose glycoforms ( fig. 1(a) ) and for complex/sialylated glycoforms ( fig. 1(b) ). the central column of table 1 lists the m/z values of 10 groups of arbitrarily ms-selected glycopeptides that were analyzed by ms/ms. in each case, ms/ms of the [mþh] þ ions of these glycopeptides allowed unambiguous identification of the respective masses of the bare peptide and carbohydrate portions. ms/ms spectra of glycopeptides were readily distinguishable from those of bare peptides. in the latter cases there was a uniform distribution of ions corresponding to the stepwise fragmentation of the backbone, whereas for glycopeptides the spectra displayed a characteristic pattern where ions, only fragments corresponding to the loss of saccharide units were observed. the presence of sialic acid was clearly identified through facile losses of these residues (à291 u). successive losses of 162 u from the precursors indicated high-mannose glycan structures, whereas mixed losses of 162 and 203 u indicated the presence of complex oligosaccharides. for all glycoforms of a given peptide, below the m/z value of [peptideþh-17] þ ions, b and y ions corresponding to fragmentation of the bare peptide provided information on its sequence. in fact, this portion of the ms/ms spectra was exploited in this study for automated peptide identification and database search for the protein of origin. this feature makes maldi-ms/ms of glycopeptide ions more useful than esi-ms/ms, where the peptide composition must be known in order to establish oligosaccharide composition. 21 a representative example is given in fig. 2 figure 3 shows an expanded view of the peptide fragmentation portion of fig. 2(b) . interestingly this portion of the spectrum did not vary with the size of the glycan attached to the peptide, i.e. from (a) to (e) in fig. 2 . the larger the glycan, the less abundant the ions, which indicates that for several glycoforms of the same peptide it is advantageous to perform ms/ms on the smallest glycoform in order to obtain the most complete peptide sequence information. interestingly, the partial spectrum of fig. 3 seems to correspond to that of hypothetical [peptideþh] þ precursors and, when entered in the 'sonar ms/ms' search algorithm, it ms/ms signatures for n-glycopeptides 2023 allowed unambiguous identification of the sequence of this peptide as ggfhnttalliqyenyr, and thus of the protein, glucose oxidase (residues 384-400). this result, among other identifications, is reported in table 1 , first column on the left. the fourth column contains the scores assigned by 'sonar ms/ms' in which a lower numerical score represents an increased level of confidence. figure 4 shows three ms/ms spectra of biantennary glycoforms of a peptide of mass 2197 u, which was later identified by 'sonar ms/ms' as belonging to human fibronectin. the largest glycoform analyzed corresponds to a disialylated oligosaccharide (bottom), the middle one to a monosialylated form (center), and the smallest to the asialo form (top) of the same glycan. features observed in the top spectrum are repeated in the center and bottom spectra after loss of one and two sialic acid residues (à291 u per unit). spectral portions above m/z 2400 exhibit successive losses of hexose (à162 u) and n-acetylglucosamine (à203 u), showing that fragmentation occurs in both chains of the biantennary glycans. in all three spectra, the [peptideþglcnac] þ ions are abundant at m/z 2400, along with [peptideþ84] þ (m/z 2280), [peptideþh] þ (m/z 2197), and [peptideþh-17] þ (m/z 2180) species. figure 5 displays a close-up of the low m/z section of fig. 4(a) , which again varies in intensity but is the same for all three ms/ms spectra in terms of ions observed. in spite of three major unidentified peaks, 'sonarms/ms' found a matching peptide with no ambiguity, dqcivddi-tynvndtfhk from human fibronectin. knowing the sequence, the unidentified peaks were quickly recognized as [yþglcnac] fragments, with the glcnac residue adding 203 u to the masses of the predicted y and b fragments. also, [yþ83] and [bþ83] fragments were identified, the 83 u portion corresponding to [ch-ch-nh-acetyl] originating from 0,2 x 0 cross-ring fragmentations of the connecting glcnac residues. 14 table 2 5, 7 all peptides identified by 'sonarms/ms' contain consensus nxt or nxs sequences (highlighted in table 1 ), thus simplifying determination of the glycosylation site. these conclusions can be confirmed, however, by assignment of [y,bþ83] and [y,bþ203] fragments. thus, for the peptide overall, ms and ms/ms analyses showed glycoforms of 10 different peptides originating from four glycoproteins present in the original mixture. table 1 summarizes these results. according to the list presented in the experimental section, other glycoproteins in the mixtures should have been identified. possible explanations for the absence of their glycopeptides from the maldi mass spectra include incomplete tryptic digestion or generation of tryptic glycopeptides outside the mass range considered in this study, discrimination in ionization efficiency due to coelution of several peptides/glycopeptides in single hplc fractions, inability to distinguish glycopeptide from peptide signals in some fractions, etc. for example, hen ovalbumin, which is well known to be n-glycosylated, was not detected as part of this glycomics analysis. inspection of the sequence of hen ovalbumin reveals that the smallest possible glycosylated peptide has a mass of 3293 da (291-322, ynltsvlmam-gitdvfsssanlsgissaeslk) without counting the glycan portion. the addition of a small hypothetical biantennary glycan would bring the mass to above 5000 da, i.e. beyond the limit of our range of observation in this study. bovine fetuin is another glycoprotein which in theory should have been fig. 4(a) , with peaks labeled according to the fragmentation of the peptide; for a complete list of the fragments detected, see table 2 . ms/ms signatures for n-glycopeptides 2027 readily identified. only two predicted tryptic peptides from this protein with consensus sequence nxs are within the range of our study once sugars are included, 145-159 (lcpdcpllaplndsr, 1740 u, alkylated) and 160-187 (vvhavevalatfnaesngsylqlveisr, 3016 u). glycoforms of both peptides were observed (see bottom of table 1 ), but no ms/ms analysis was performed to ascertain their identification, which was based on previous knowledge of the sequence of fetuin. two other fetuin peptides, 651-682 and 72-103, could also be glycosylated, but are outside our observation range. it is important to note that identification of all possible glycopeptides was not the primary goal of this study, which rather focused on utilizing maldi-ms peaks left unidentified following peptide mapping experiments 17, 18 and assigning these peaks to glycopeptides using their typical ms and ms/ms patterns. the identification of all proteins and glycoproteins in similar mixtures was performed previously without making use of glycopeptide signals, 17, 18 which become useful when information on glycosylation is required. here, precursor ions were chosen arbitrarily for ms/ms analysis based on easy visual recognition of glycosylated patterns. identification of six peptides from four glycoproteins was achieved using an automatic 'sonarms/ms' search. the corresponding scores are indicated in the fourth column of table 1 . at present, our laboratory is working on developing an algorithm to recognize the presence of glycopeptide ions through their characteristic mass differences (162, 203, 291 u) and to flag such ions for further ms/ms work. this automated process will surely increase the number of glycopeptides found and broaden the scope of proteomics analyses by including glycosylation data. two peptides contained a modification other than glycosylation, which led to a decrease of 17 u from the masses of the predicted peptides. in the first case, qqqhlfgsnvtdcsgnfclfr from human transferrin, the modification was due to formation of pyroglutamic acid at the n-terminal, as is always observed during proteolytic digestion. 22 glycoforms with this modification eluted in the fraction next to their analogs with intact glutamic acid at the n-terminal. the other source of mass loss of 17 u was observed for cglvpvlaenynk, also from human transferrin, where cysteine at the n-terminal was alkylated with iodoacetamide and converted into 5-oxo-thiomorpholine-3carboxylic acid in a manner similar to n-terminal gln. 22 figure 6 shows the m/z 4000-5000 portions of the maldi spectra obtained for fractions 76, 77 and 78 of a separation of the digested mixture. as observed, whether the glycosylated peptide is intact (figs. 6(a) and 6(b)) or modified by formation of pyroglutamic acid at the n-terminal (fig. 6(c) ), it maintains a similar glycosylation pattern. only one glycopeptide could not be sequenced either automatically or manually, owing to the low extent of fragmentation of very large precursor ions, i.e. m/z 4825.975, although it was possible by ms/ms to determine the relative masses of glycans vs. peptide (see table 1 ). indeed, [peptideþh] þ ions had m/z 3203.39 and the observed glycoforms corresponded to asialo biantennary and monosialo biantennary structures. another glycopeptide, qqqhlfgsnvtdcsgnfclfr, which was discussed above, had to be sequenced manually from ms/ms data due to low intensity fragments not assigned by 'm/z'. these two particular cases show the importance of maximizing the sensitivity of ms/ms analyses by either selecting the most abundant glycoform as a parent species, optimizing the collision energy, or selecting the smallest glycoform, if abundant enough, to conduct the experiment. some of the glycoproteins included in the mixtures have already been the object of detailed studies on glycosylation, and our results agree with previously reported glycosylation types and sites. in the case of human transferrin, tomiya et al. 23 reported complex-type biantennary and highmannose n-glycans in the overall oligosaccharide pool of recombinant glycoproteins grown in trichoplusia ni insect cells. in our study, two glycopeptides were detected and corresponded to residues 421-433 (glycosylation on asn 432) and to 622-642 (asn 630). both asn residues were found to table 2 . ms/ms peaks assignments for the peptide dqcivdditynvndtfhk from human fibronectin. corresponding ms/ms spectra are shown in fig. 4 (a) (glycosylated peptide, m/z 3819.582) and the expanded section below m/z 2197 in fig. 5 residue 23 several biantennary glycans were fucosylated and all were digalactosylated, but none were sialylated. here the source of human transferrin was commercial (sigma chemicals), and the protein was obtained by purification from cell culture, human rather than insect, and thus with different transferase activity levels that possibly explain these differences. our study did not detect high-mannose glycans for this protein. for the purposes of database search and protein identifications, both glycopeptides observed here and sequenced by ms/ms were sufficient to point to human transferrin. a more detailed glycosylation study would require enzymatic detaching of the glycans followed by separation and structural analysis. 23 a second glycoprotein of interest in this study, bovine lactoferrin, has also been the subject of previous investigations; 24, 25 five glycosylation sites were found in these studies. asn-233 and asn-545 had high-mannose glycans, whereas asn-281, asn-368 and asn-476 had complex-type glycans. in our study only one glycopeptide from bovine lactoferrin was detected, residues 545-562, with asn-545 indeed bearing high-mannose glycans, as observed by wei et al. 25 based on ms/ms fragmentation of one glycoform of this peptide, 'sonarms/ms' was able to identify the correct glycoprotein and, once this information was obtained, other predictable glycopeptides could be sought; this was not done as part of this study, which was rather aimed at quickly screening for glycopeptides in ms spectra of tryptic digests of several proteins/glycoproteins. because glycopeptide signals are easy to distinguish among other peptide ions, these signals can be used efficiently as part of a proteomics study. the features discussed here have been exploited in other cases in our laboratory, where digests of individual proteins were separated by reversed-phase hplc followed by ontarget deposition. for example, nine n-glycopeptides from the spike protein of the coronavirus associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) have been characterized and sequenced using this approach. 13 as another example, integrin a5b1 complexes isolated from human placenta were subjected to this process. a more complete set of data on this complex will be presented in a ms/ms signatures for n-glycopeptides 2029 further paper, but the results presented here as an example are only for one very short glycopeptide, nvtr (269-272) from integrin b1, observed in at least two different nglycoforms. the ms/ms spectra shown in fig. 7 correspond to these glycoforms, which comprise a (hex) 5 (hexnac) 4 structure (m/z 2111.9) and a truncated version of the latter, (hex) 4 (hexnac) 3 (m/z 1746.7). even with this short asparagine-glycosylated peptide, a quadruplet of characteristic ions is observed in each spectrum ([peptideþh-17] þ , [peptideþh] þ , [peptideþ84] þ , [peptideþglcnac] þ ). peptide sequence ions (y and b) are observed at low mass and allow us to identify the peptide unequivocally as residues 269-272, nvtr, from subunit b1 of the integrin complex, whose precursor is a 798 amino acid chain. a detailed study on the n-glycosylation patterns of integrin a3b1 complexes has recently been published by pochec et al., 26 emphasizing their changes with melanoma progression; the types of glycans observed here were also reported by these authors. as for the a5b1, a detailed study on disulfide bonding in this complex has recently been published by krokhin et al., 27 but more details on site-specific glycosylation are still needed and will be the object of a further study by our group. we have shown that maldi-ms glycopeptide signals can be usefully integrated into data sets in proteomics studies, because they produce very informative maldi-ms/ms fragment ions, allowing sequencing of the peptides and deduction of the sugar composition of each glycoform. the lower mass peptide portions of ms/ms spectra of glycopeptides can be interpreted automatically using a search engine such as 'sonarms/ms'. incorporation of glycopeptide signals in global proteomics studies would constitute a truly complementary asset as it does significantly increase protein coverage. development of software for automatic assignment of glycopeptide precursor ions is underway and will be discussed in a future publication.\n",

      ";  250000  coronaviruses are positive-stranded rna viruses which are enveloped and their envelope fused with host cell membrane with the spike glycoprotein (s) mediating the virus entry into cell [1] . there have been reports of efficient in vitro inhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) with drugs remdesivir (gs-5734) and chloroquine (cq) phosphate [2] . a recent study by mehra et al. [3] has shown hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide, chloroquine, and chloroquine with a macrolide all increased in-hospital mortality as well as de novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalization although asians consisted only 7.9% of the total study population. in this study, it was interesting to find that the asian population benefited from the combinations with a hazard ratio and 95% ci of 0.717 (0.668-0.769), showing a decrease in in-hospital mortality. soon after the publication, this study has received a sharp criticism from all over the world regarding their design of sample collection and many other issues [4] , and a signed letter was forwarded to the lancet regarding the concerns of the trial [5] . just after this publication, the uk's recovery trial body [nct04381936] went back to reassess their interim data of the safety of their ongoing trial drugs, which included hcq, and found no safety concerns and hence did not stop the trial [6] . based on the severe criticism, the article was soon retracted [7] . reports have also shown that the risk is increased with the combination of two separate drugs, each of which can cause drug-induced qt prolongation leading to torsade de pointes (tdp) and subsequent ventricular arrhythmia (va) [8] . a french study showed a significant benefit when hcq was used in covid-19 patients in reducing or even clearing sars-cov-2 viral rna load in 6 days, and the addition of azithromycin reinforced the chances [9] . these conflicting results are creating massive confusion among the medical fraternity. another retrospective multicenter cohort study involving 1438 hospitalized patients (mostly white) with covid-19 showed no mortality benefit with the hcq + az combination, but cardiac arrest was significantly higher in the combination group than with each drug alone [10] . unfortunately, there are rare papers on this combination drug from the asian subcontinent, and hence other publications are looked for where this combination was used. in a study on uncomplicated falciparum malaria from india, we found a significant improvement in clinical and parasitologic outcomes, combined with cure rates of almost 97%, but at the same time, there were no serious cardiac adverse outcomes [11] . animal study in an anesthetized guinea pig showed that the combination of az with chloroquine did not have any added potential to cause arrhythmias [12] . another study with two groups investigating the pharmacokinetic interaction with the combination of chloroquine and az did not find any clinically significant pk interaction [13] . it has been often seen that az causes cardiac arrhythmias mostly in aged, ill patients with many comorbidities and concomitant medications, which put them intrinsically to high cv risk groups [14] . the chances of prolongation of the qtc (corrected qt) interval and subsequent risk of torsade de pointes (tdp) with hcq are found to be dose dependant where it is seen that the mean increases in qtc are 6.1 ms after a dose of 600 mg and 28 ms after a dose of 1200 mg [15] . sudden cardiac death (scd) is seen in almost 40 cases per 100,000 persons per year in each country of asia, which is lower than in europe or the usa, where we find ranges from 50 to 100 per 100,000 persons per year [16] . the commonest fatal cascade in scd appears to start with ventricular tachycardia (vt) degenerating first to ventricular fibrillation (vf) and later to asystole [16] . in a retrospective cohort study [17] to see the reason of the lower burden of cardiac arrhythmias as compared with caucasians, it was found that the south asians had a significantly shorter qrs duration (p = 0.012), higher resting heart rate (p = 0.024), and a shorter atrioventricular (p = 0.001) and ventriculoatrial (p = 0.013) effective refractory period. in another study, it was seen that asians were having less non-valvular atrial fibrillation than caucasians [18] . there has been a case report in covid-19 patients showing severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction of 35%), diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, diffuse st segment elevation, and high-sensitivity troponin t and nt-probnp levels [19] . in another study from wuhan, china, it was seen that 26.1% were transferred to the intensive care unit due to complications, and 44.4% of them had arrhythmias [20] . azithromycin was used in 18.1% and moxifloxacin in 64.4% of patients in this study. increased troponin t levels have also been associated with malignant arrhythmias [21] . a summary of a few trials investigating these two drugs is given in table 1 . apart from infarction and heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia in infectious disease is mostly related to myocarditis, proinflammatory effects, and sympathetic overstimulation. guo et al., 2020 [21] proposed the mechanisms of the myocardial injury with sars-cov-2 infection in the form of direct viral infection, causing extensive damage to the myocytes in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases and indirectly by cytokine storm-mediated systemic inflammatory responses that destabilized coronary plaque and aggravated hypoxia. the cytokine storm seen in severe covid-19 patients can cause a reduction in coronary blood flow, leading to impaired oxygen supply and subsequent hypoxia-induced myocardial damage as well as microthrombogenesis [21] . in critically ill patients of sars-cov-2 infection, thrombotic complications have been reported due to virus-induced endotheliitis [22, 23] . pan et al. [24] suggested a few probable mechanisms of cardiac arrest in patients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak, and that same concept is now being extrapolated to explain the arrhythmias n sars-cov-2. they share the view that (a) sars-induced lung injury leads to hypoxemia and an altered, imbalanced state in myocardial electricity; (b) direct damage to the new myocardial cells and/or conduction system; (c) aggravation of pre-existing morbidities related to myocardium or conduction disturbances; and (d) endogenous catecholamine release owing to the severe anxiety in the patients that leads to further myocardial electrical instability. in general, atrial fibrillation is a major predisposing factor to scd, but in patients without af, scd, and va, it increase consistently with age [25] . ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are reported in higher proportions with elevated troponin t levels [26] . the potential role of pharmacological interventions in causing prolongation of corrected qt (qtc) interval must be remembered as these drugs are now quite often used in these frail patients of covid-19 and include the commonly used drugs hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. antimalarial drugs like hydroxychloroquine have a direct effect on ventricular repolarization by blocking the kcnh2-encoded herg/k v 11.1 potassium channel and potentially prolonging the qtc [8] . the macrolide azithromycin also shares the same mechanism of blockade of the rapid component, ikr, of the delayed rectifier potassium current ik [27] . the cytokine storm seen in severe covid-19 patients leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) by releasing many cytokines like interleukin (il)-1b, il-6, il-12 and various chemokines [28] , with il-6, il-1 modulating the expression and/or function of cardiac k+ and ca++ channels, thereby causing prolongation of ventricular action potential duration, which finally predisposes to arrhythmias [29] . tisdale et al. have created a tisdale risk score for hospitalized patients to predict qtc > 500 msec [30] . this score, nowadays, is in routine use for covid-19 patients starting hcq, and it states that a risk score of ≤ 6 confers low risk, 7-10 medium risk, and ≥ 11 high risk of drug-associated qtc prolongation [30] . druginduced qt prolongation risk is around 6%, and out of that, 0.3% have a chance to develop tdp, and va risk is seen in 2.6% and the risk to be increased when concomitant multiple qt-prolonging drugs are used [31] . the intensive care unit (icu) of a hospital is dedicated to deal with the sickest of the patients who are already hemodynamically deranged and have multiple existing comorbidities. the qt prolongation with drugs in such a situation seems quite likely. hence, we often see monitoring of such patients using automatic qt monitoring systems [32] . some of the risk factors and drugs leading to tdp have been summarized in table 2 [33] . ethnic variations have come to focus after the discrepancies seen in the deaths across many countries [34] , and probable reasons for the minorities to suffer more from covid-19 are increased admission risk for acute respiratory tract infections [35] , increased vitamin d deficiency prevalence [36] , countryspecific vaccination policies [37] , and increased inflammatory markers with high cv risk [38] . studies have shown that asians are different in many genetical aspects like the absence of the polymorphic enzyme, cyp2c19, in almost 20% of the population, which helps in the metabolism of proton pump inhibitors (e.g., pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole), antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, citalopram), antiplatelet drug (clopidogrel), antifungals (e.g., voriconazole), and anticancer drug (e.g., cyclophosphamide) [39] . higher polymorphisms are seen in gene cyp2d6, which are higher in white caucasians and, hence, are more predisposed to druginduced prolonged qtc [40] . the frequency of variant kcnh2 alleles are much more in caucasians and are much more predisposed to develop drug-induced prolonged qt [41] . brugada syndrome, an scn5a (cardiac sodium channel gene)-linked genetic channelopathy predisposing to sudden cardiac death, is nine times and 36 times more common in asians than caucasians and hispanics, respectively [42, 43] . atrial fibrillation (af) seems to be lower in incidence in asians than the western population [44] . a meta-analysis of 7 prospective randomized clinical trials recruiting 94,785 patients demonstrated that asians had significantly lower rates of non-valvular af (p = 0.001) as compared with the white population [45] . hsu jc et al. found that individuals of asian races commonly have the right anterior accessory pathways [46] . there is also variation in gene expressions related to the long qt syndrome (lqts), where asians show kcnq1 g643s polymorphism in a higher degree than caucasians [47] . polymorphisms are often ethnicity specific like herg p448r and a915v in asians only [47] . genes predisposing an individual to drug-induced torsade de pointes are herg-p347s, r784w [48] , scn5a-l1825p, s1102y [49] , etc. a study combining both retrospective approach and prospective approach found 25% deaths in sudden cardiac deaths (scd) category in their 5-year retrospective approach and 21 scd victims in their 2-year prospective approach, out of which arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy constituted 10%, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy shared 5%, and 85% had negative autopsy [50] . a retrospective case-control study to determine the lower risk of af in south asians, involving 60 south asians and 60 caucasians, found that the left atrial size was smaller in south asians as compared with caucasians with lower left ventricular mass (p = 0.022), all of which might lead to a reduced risk of arrhythmogenic substrate formation (e.g., reentry circuit, fibrosis development) [51] . another prospective study involving both caucasians and south asians found that the south asians had significantly narrower qrs complex (p < 0.001 for males and p = 0.002 for females), shorter qtc interval (p = 0.038, females), lower p wave dispersion (p = 0.039 for males and p = 0.004 for females), and lower supraventricular ectopic activity (p = 0.024 for males, p = 0.004 for females) [52] . it is likely that the severe covid-19 patients are aged, fragile, and hemodynamically unstable with multiple existing comorbidities, and, hence they are prone to develop cardiac arrhythmias of all sorts. from the above facts, we can see that asians are less susceptible than caucasians in developing cardiac arrhythmias in general, but the scenario might not be antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, sotalol), antibiotics (macrolides, fluoroquinolones), antimycotics (fluconazole, voriconazole), antiviral drugs (atazanavir), antiemetics (ondansetron, domperidone), antidepressives (amitriptyline, sertraline), antipsychotics (haloperidol, clozapine), antimalarials (quinine, chloroquine, halofantrine, quinidine), and others applicable in the face of a cytokine storm that goes on in the severe covid-19 patients. hence, in these situations, we must maintain extreme cautiousness while prescribing these combination drugs, which can prolong the qt interval. severe covid-19 patients should be kept out of these potential arrhythmogenic drug combinations until we get the results from dedicated randomized clinical trials (rcts). until that time, we must use hcq as a prophylactic drug in that population who have a normal baseline qtc or in patients with mild disease and not having any previous myocardial injury or cv risk factor and should be followed up closely with serial ecgs if needed to see any change after starting the drug. similarly, az use should be restricted to mild covid-19 infections only until further data is available in critically ill patients from rcts. ethical declaration not required since it is an analysis of existing literatures without any direct patient participation.\n",

      ";  260000  the instruction of jesus at the last supper, when he gave his disciples bread, saying \"this is my body,\" and wine, saying \"this is my blood.\" during the festive dinner (seder) on passover, jews recall the plagues that god inflicted on the egyptians. those attending the ceremony recite aloud the name of each of the 10 plagues, spilling a drop of wine as each is intoned. the first plague was \"blood\" (\"dam\" in hebrew). these rituals demonstrate that blood has great symbolic significance; in addition, it can arouse strong emotions. for example, some people develop a pathologic fear of blood; the mere sight or even the thought of seeing blood induces fainting. the main protagonist in the contemporary british television comedy series, \"doc martin,\" has to relinquish his career as a surgeon because of a violent reaction (vomiting) at the sight of blood. blood is not a homogeneous liquid; it contains various cellular elements. these were initially described by antonj van leeuwenhoek in 1674 [5] . he wrote: \"the blood is composed of exceeding small particles, named globules, which, in most animals are of a red color, swimming in a liquor, called by physicians, the serum…\" [5] . today, we know that the average person weighing 150 pounds has approximately 5 quarts of blood containing approximately 2 quarts of cells comprising 10 13 (more than 20 trillion) individual cells. this cellular compartment contains red cells, white cells, and platelets; all are progeny of parent or stem cells that reside in the bone marrow. the red cells provide the tissues with oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, the white cells fight infection, and the platelets assist in blood coagulation. individual red cells circulate for 120 days and platelets circulate for 10 days, but most white cells have a lifespan of only a few hours. during febrile illnesses, a thick green layer of white cells and proteins appears on the surface of blood allowed to clot in a test tube. this was called phlegm by ancient philosophers and was thought to cause disease; removing the blood was seen as a way of ridding the body of this noxious material [6] . blood-letting became the preferred treatment for many disorders well into the 19th century. the practice was accompanied by purging with emetics; there is no doubt that the major loss of bodily fluids from these \"treatments\" resulted in a decrease in blood pressure (shock) and the death of many sufferers. most remarkably, blood-letting was even applied to control hemorrhages in persons with hemophilia! [7] . in his 1872 treatise on haemophilia, the english physician, wickham legg, warned that \"the terrible danger attending its use (bloodletting) must deter every careful practitioner from such an idea.\" he stated further that \"death has very frequently followed its employment, and the danger of this more than counterbalances any probable good\" [8] . he and others advocated purging; this practice probably induced dehydration and decreased blood pressure, possibly benefiting a bleeding person by slowing the rate of blood loss. anemia was one of the first clinical disorders directly linked to blood. for hundreds of years, a condition called chlorosis had been recognized in young women, and it often had a fatal outcome. these women usually had a history of heavy menstrual periods and/or multiple pregnancies, and their skin was a sickly green color. they were probably very anemic; a study by gabriel andral in 1845 reported that their red blood cells were remarkably small [9] . a decrease in the size of the red cells is characteristic of iron deficiency anemia. iron is essential for red cell production, and most of the body's iron resides in the red blood cells. this iron is lost when there is excessive menstrual bleeding or blood loss at the time of childbirth. during the 19th century, physicians confirmed that chlorotic blood contained less than the normal amount of iron, and they found that iron preparations were an effective treatment [10] . a method for dying red cells so that the small cells of iron deficiency could be differentiated from the large cells found in vitamin b 12 deficiency (the cause of pernicious anemia) was subsequently developed by the nobel prize-winning physician and scientist, paul ehrlich (1854-1915) [11] . although iron salts are effective in treating anemia due to chronic blood loss, acute bleeding requires a more rapid method for restoring blood volume. this is accomplished by blood transfusion, which was first attempted in dogs as early as 1666 [12] . the success of transfusion in animals was followed by the infusion of animal blood into humans, with often fatal outcomes, and led to a moratorium on further transfusions. however, in 1818, blundell reported successful transfusions in four women with postpartum hemorrhages by using blood from their husbands [13] . however, subsequent experiences with transfusion were dismal and the practice was abandoned until the 20th century. in 1901, karl landsteiner, a viennese physician, discovered the existence of blood groups [14] . he separated serum (the liquid appearing after blood has clotted) from the red cells and showed that sera from some individuals would cause clumping (agglutination) of other persons' red cells, and vice versa. the first group was said to have group a cells and the second group was said to have group b cells. in addition, there were instances in which the cells would not be agglutinated by sera from either group a or group b, and he called these group c (now called group o) cells. subsequently, a fourth group, ab, was delineated in which the cells are agglutinated by sera from groups a and b. these were enormously important discoveries, and landsteiner was awarded the nobel prize. since that time, many other blood groups (rh, duffy, kell) were identified and characterized. the red cell agglutination that landsteiner described occurs whenever there is a mismatch between the cells of the donor and those of the recipient. it is due to the formation of antibodies by the recipient that recognize that the donor red cells are nonself or foreign. the antibodies in the serum attach to the red cells and cause them to agglutinate. this is an example of an immune response that has evolved to protect individuals from potentially dangerous nonself organisms such as viruses and bacteria. humans are immersed in a world of microbes that are trying to survive by feasting on the body's cells and tissues, and to defend against this persistent attack a sophisticated system has evolved to recognize and destroy these invaders. this system comprises two components, the innate and adaptive immune systems. the innate immune system consists of a set of genetically determined cell surface components capable of recognizing the chemical signatures of a variety of disease-causing microbes. these protective components are designed for the immediate engagement and killing of foreign organisms [15] and include several types of cells and their secreted products. on detection of an invader, white blood cells release antimicrobial agents that can kill bacteria directly or trigger other cells to ingest the organisms and degrade them. one type of white blood cell, the neutrophil, defends against infection by extruding fibers that enmesh and immobilize bacteria. these neutrophil extracellular traps have only recently been discovered and are an important component of the immune defense repertoire [16] . the other component of immunity is the adaptive immune system. various species of scavenger cells-dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes-patrol our bodies looking for microbial threats [17] . when these cells encounter a foreign protein, they attach this protein to a region on their surface called the major histocompatibility complex (mhc). they then travel to the lymphoid tissues, where they present the microbial protein to thymus-derived lymphocytes called t cells. t cells have cd4 molecules on their surface that can bind the mhcmicrobial product complexes; this event signals for a series of changes in the t cells. they multiply, release molecules that assist in the killing of bacteria, and attach to another type of lymphocyte called the b cell. b cells produce antibodies directed against the specific invader; they also retain a memory of the encounter so that they can rapidly mount a defense if there are future exposures to this agent. cd4-bearing lymphocytes are the target of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), and their destruction by the virus wreaks havoc on the immune system (described in later chapters). this brief review of the immune system provides a foundation for understanding the responses people have to transfusions of blood and blood products. blood banks attempt to closely match the red cells of the donor and recipient. however, recipients who have had multiple previous transfusions often have developed a variety of antibodies, and locating compatible donor red cells for them can be problematic. if mismatched red cells are transfused, they will be quickly destroyed and the recipient might experience chills, fever, and kidney damage. deleterious reactions can occur not only to the red blood cells, but also to the proteins derived from the blood, such as the clotting factors used to treat hemophilia. a basic premise of the immune response is that foreign proteins are recognized as being different from the person's own proteins [18] . this response can be harmful to people with bleeding disorders, because the coagulation proteins that they receive might be identified as nonself, and the immune responses that are provoked can result in the loss of the beneficial clotting activity. in addition, the burden of these infused proteins might overwhelm cellular immune mechanisms and blunt the antibody responses to subsequent encounters with the proteins of infecting microbes. as discussed in later chapters, some hemophilia physicians had difficulty distinguishing between the immune depletion due to hiv infection and the changes in the immune system resulting from prior treatments with clotting proteins. the next important advance in the use of blood as a therapeutic material came in the early part of the 20th century with the development of methods to prevent blood clotting [19] . these generally involved the addition of sodium citrate to the blood, but it took several years before it was recognized that the citrate solution had to be sterile to avoid inducing fever in transfusion recipients. once blood clotting could be safely prevented, blood storage became feasible. in 1937, fantus established the first blood bank at cook county hospital in chicago [20] . it was called a bank because it was envisioned that blood would be deposited by healthy individuals and subsequently withdrawn by those in need. to maintain a positive balance, donors needed to be recruited; they could be motivated to donate either as an altruistic act or with a monetary reward. initially, many donors were paid, but with the advent of world war ii, volunteer donors came to provide the majority of the blood required [21] . after the war, the american red cross established regional blood centers across the united states, and they were supplemented by more than 4000 hospital and community blood banks. during the years after world war ii, the number of persons receiving blood transfusions dramatically increased due, in part, to major campaigns to recruit blood donors and the development of better methods for blood collection, storage, and administration. however, as more patients were transfused, adverse reactions became more common. perhaps the most frequent was fever, which complicated 1-3% of all transfusions. this was due to the presence of antibodies in the patient's blood that attacked the white cells transfused with the donor blood [22] . the products released by disrupted white cells provoked chills and fever in the transfusion recipient. in addition, allergic reactions were reported in 3% of transfusions [23] , possibly due to the sensitivity of the recipient to foods or drugs in the donor blood. this could occur if blood from someone who had recently eaten strawberries was given to a person allergic to this fruit. another type of reaction, known as transfusion-related acute lung injury, occurred when a type of white cell known as a neutrophil was activated by antibodies in the donor's blood [24] . the products released by these neutrophils injured the lungs [25] . today, these sorts of reactions have become less frequent because most donor blood is filtered to remove the white cells prior to transfusion. currently, most severe reactions are due to human errors in typing, cross-matching, or mislabeling of blood products. infusion of mislabeled or misdirected blood can result in the rapid destruction of the infused red cells and a fatal or near-fatal outcome for the recipient. blood transfusions can be harmful in other ways. for example, transfusions were shown to increase the risk of death more than twofold when given to people who have had acute heart attacks [26] . in individuals undergoing colorectal cancer surgery, transfusions during the procedure were associated with significant increases in cancer recurrence, postoperative infection, the need for surgical re-intervention, and mortality [27] . the quality of the blood transfused might also contribute to poor transfusion outcomes. current guidelines permit storage of blood for up to 6 weeks; during storage, the capacity of the red cells to deliver oxygen declines, some of the cells break apart (hemolyze), and the risk of bacterial contamination might increase [28] . initially, some studies showed that rates of survival after heart surgery were better in patients receiving transfused blood stored less than 2 weeks [29] , but more recent trials found no greater organ dysfunction in those receiving transfusions with older versus fresh blood [30, 31] . contracting infection from contaminated blood is another major problem associated with transfusion. as previously noted, blood must be collected, stored, and infused using sterile precautions. if the donor is infected, or if the stored blood becomes contaminated by bacteria, then the organisms will be transmitted to the recipient. transmission of hepatitis virus from donors to recipients was first reported in 1943 by paul beeson, who described jaundice in seven patients that appeared within 1-4 months after transfusion [32] . it was soon recognized that the risk of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis was greatest if the blood donors were drug abusers or prisoners, especially those with a history of using shared needles. these people usually donated because they were paid for their blood or, in the case of prisoners, rewarded with freedom from confinement. to decrease financial motivation for giving blood, the red cross and other blood collectors initiated a policy of no monetary compensation for blood donations and discontinued blood drives at prisons. in addition to hepatitis, malaria and a variety of other infectious agents can be transmitted by transfusion [33-36a,b] . the table lists because many of these microbes can reside in the tissues and blood for months to years without inducing symptoms, 1 the donors might not appear ill at the time of the blood donation. unfortunately, there are no currently approved methods for sterilizing the blood itself, but several companies are working on various pathogen (germ) reduction techniques; some involve adding chemicals to the blood and exposing it to ultraviolet light to kill viruses and bacteria [37] . because procedures to safely sterilize blood are still unavailable, blood banks have adopted extensive screening procedures to detect infections in donors and the indications for blood transfusions include acute blood loss that is sufficiently severe to alter the function of vital organs; this might be due to surgery, injury, pregnancy, or diseases such as ulcers or cancer. transfusions are also prescribed for individuals who are unable to make blood, and they are administered when the blood level falls to less than half the normal amount [39] . infants born with certain heart and lung defects might also need transfusions, as do some individuals with sickle cell anemia. there are several other indications for transfusion; for example, blood is required for many cardiovascular procedures requiring the use of mechanical devices. to collect sufficient quantities of blood to meet the various medical needs, the current completely voluntary system depends on donations by large groups from schools and businesses (blood drives), as well as donations by individuals. because of all the mentioned reasons for donor deferral, it is estimated that only 38% of the population is eligible to give blood and only a fraction of those actually donate [40] . extensive advertising and public service announcements are used to enlist volunteer donors (fig. 3.1) . currently, most physicians have adopted conservative policies for prescribing transfusions and only order blood for patients likely to fare poorly because of a low blood count [41] . the use of transfusions in the united states has declined by 30% since 2009, from 15 million units to 11 million units, and blood bank revenue has decreased from $5 billion to $1.5 billion [42] . there are alternatives to the use of banked blood; for example, prior to surgery anemic patients can be treated with a hormone, erythropoietin, to increase their blood counts, and during surgical procedures shed blood can be recycled back to the patient. blood donation is a unique form of altruistic behavior, one in which the donor does not receive the tangible rewards customarily given for other virtuous acts [43] . most people agree to donate because they feel a sense of moral obligation and responsibility to the community [44] . repeat donors probably also experience pleasurable internal feelings associated with the knowledge that they are contributing to restoring the health of others. in the 1970s, there was a third group of persons who regularly donated blood. these were men who had sex with men, and they constituted a sizeable percentage of repeat donors, especially on the west coast. their motivation to donate is unclear, but it could have been due to a need to counterbalance their negative social image with a positive contribution to society, or to show that their blood was just as good and beneficial as blood from anyone else. those who donated blood in the late 1970s and early 1980s were almost certainly not aware that they had become infected with hiv. in the following chapters we see how blood from hiv-positive homosexual men became the fatal link between hemophilia and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). • there are many references to blood in our vocabulary, religious life, and social interactions. most of the knowledge about blood composition, blood groups, collection, and storage accrued during the past two centuries. • innate and adaptive immune systems defend against invading microorganisms, but occasionally they construe transfused blood products as foreign proteins and inactivate them. • technical improvements led to a remarkable increase in the number of blood transfusions after world war ii. • recent studies suggest that the benefits of transfusion are limited, and blood conservation procedures have been widely adopted. • it is now recognized that blood can be a vehicle for the transmission of an extensive variety of infectious agents. • although drug abusers and prisoners were excluded from donating blood, a sizeable percentage of the blood donors in the 1970s were men who had sex with men. • although there are no methods for sterilizing blood, screening of donors and donated blood for several microbial organisms is now routine, and infected units are not used for transfusion.\n",

      ";  270000  health concern. since a patient with pneumonia of unknown etiology were firstly reported in the city of wuhan on 30th of dec, 2019., subsequently, epidemiological, clinical, radiological, laboratory and genomic findings of this virus gradually revealed by the chinese and 00 experts around the globe [1] . at current stage, however, two topics emerged as things that needed to be addressed. firstly, according to latest diagnostic criteria, reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) assays are recommended as the standard diagnosis of sars-cov-2-infection. despite, present studies found that some patients had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacity, but negative rt-pcr testing [2] . the false-negative rt-pcr results may cause by many reasons, especially insufficient detection sensitivity in a low viral load scenario [2] . secondly, although, by using metagenome sequencing, the complete genome sequence, taxonomic position, potential intermediate hosts, and evolutionary history of sars-cov-2 have been already reported [3] [4] [5] [6] , it is more important to monitor the virus mutation and its influence on disease severity and progression. necessitating the full-length of sars-cov-2 genome, metagenome sequencing technology is the latest and most comprehensive approach but still costly. moreover, in metagenome sequencing library, there are human (host) nucleic acid contamination cannot be eliminated. inevitably, the carrier rna introduced by commercial rna extraction kits presented as contamination in library preparation stage, which indeed impairs the amount of viral sequence readout. in the context, we developed a set of sars-cov-2 enrichment probes, by utilizing hybridization capture technology, to increase the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and characterization. this method was first used to enrich sequence targets from the human genome [7] and then from vertebrate virome [8] . the enrichment probe set contains 502 ssdna biotin-labelled probes at 2x tiling designed based on all available sars-cov-2 viral sequences, downloaded from the gisaid (global initiative on sharing all influenza data; https://www.gisaid.org/) on 2/1/2020, and it can be used to enrich for sars-cov-2 sequences without prior knowledge of type or subtype. additionally, the probes for human housekeeping genes (gapdh, pcbp1, eif3l, polr2a, eif3a, tgoln2, tceb3, cdk12, and btbd7) were spiked in the probe set as internal controls for studying viral expression. the sars-cov-2 virus isolation and culturing was reported previously, which followed the cdc guidelines and good practice in laboratory health and safety requirement. experiments were performed with approvals of w96-027b framework. therefore, a sars-cov-2 virus strain (20sf014) was cultured in vero-e6 cell, and rna preparation performed using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). the cell culture media was collected and tested for viral rna using the rt-pcr amplicons of partial orf1ab with ct value 36, and n gene regions with ct value 33, respectively. we divided the total rna sample into six samples (with following slightly different experimental conditions) ( table 1) the cutadapt (version 2.7) and trimmonmatic (version 0.38) software was used for clipping adaptors and trimming low-quality reads. after removing adaptor, low-quality, and low-complexity reads, high-quality reads were first filtered against the human reference genome (hg 38) using burrows-wheeler alignment (mem). the remaining non-human reads were then realigned to the sars-cov-2 reference (mn908947.3, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/mn908947) using bowtie2 (version 2.3.4.1) and filtered reads according to mapping quality (-q 30) by samtools (version 1.10). the variant was called by samtools and varscan (version 2.3.9, parameter: --strand-filter 0 --min-avg-qual 30 --min-reads2 15 --min-coverage 15). finally, the sample consensus sequence was created by samtools and bcftools (version 1.9) according to the variants called above. the results illustrated in table 6 , for library 1-6, 4,797,881-199,421,414 unique reads were obtained. among them, 4,412,665-192,545,532 reads were mapped to sars-cov-2 reference sequence (mn908947.3). the fraction of sars-cov-2 endogenous dna from these enrichment libraries were found to be between 90.07% and 96.58%, demonstrating that the numbers of mapped reads to sars-cov-2 reference sequence significantly increased, compared to metagenomic sequencing technology, following sars-cov-2 probe enrichment. the library complexity is evaluated by cluster factor, which is defined by \"the number of raw reads divided . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0

this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061507 doi: medrxiv preprint by the number of reads after removing duplicates\". in our six enrichment libraries, the cluster factor is about 1.1. the closer to 1, the better the library construction is. notably, when adding the pcr cycle numbers of library amplification from 15 to 17, the library quality gets better. collectively, merging the data from six enrichment libraries, a total of 371,981,580 reads were obtained, among which 358,112,573 reads were mapped to sars-cov-2 reference. using these unique sars-cov-2 fragments, we reconstructed six sars-cov-2 genomes (mean depth being 186,869× and minimum coverage 13,816×). only the merged sequence (coverage 1,121,217×) was used for further analysis. there are five variants called from merged data, including one homozygous variant at snp (t23569c), and four heterozygotic variants (three snps: c4534t, a5522t, c23525t, and one deletion: ct16779c). the phenomenon of heterozygosity had also been reported in previous studies [6, 10] , but we propose that this heterogeneity could be caused by the mutations that occur during viral cultivation or the infection by multi-strain of coronavirus. table s1 ). five clades could be identified and labelled, corresponding to the full genome tree delivered by gisaid (see figure 1 ). in figure 2 , we found two peaks in genome sequencing depths, one covering the 5'utr region (mn908947.3:1-256) and another covering the n region (mn908947.3:28274-29533), which may be associated with the high expression in these two regions during replication of coronavirus [11] [12] . for high sequencing depths in 5'utr region, a reasonable explanation is that 5'utrs before orf1a is necessary for the discontinuous synthesis of sub genomic rnas in the beta coronaviruses and contains the cis-acting sequences necessary for viral replication [11] . clinically, n gene rt-pcr assay was found to be more sensitive than other genes in sars-cov-2 detection, which is consistent with our finding of high sequencing depths in n region. this can be explained as the structural composition of coronavirus, also the difference in expression regulation in the host cells regarding sub genomic mrna [12] [13] [14] in the current study, we, based on the available sars-cov-2 virus sequences, designed a set of sars-cov-2 enrichment probes. we made six enrichment libraries from one cultured sars-cov-2 virus strain to test the enrichment effects and sequenced them on mgi-2000 platform. overall, the sars-cov-2 enrichment probe set-up described in this study showed significance in sars-cov-2-specific enrichment. this high specific probe rate with rna carrier-free approach can function as a useful tool for the sars-cov-2 research community, especially in detecting sars-cov-2 rna in low amounts and monitoring the virus evolution . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder, who has

wan et al., 1998) . b. burgdorferi s.l. has been detected in more than 20 mammalian species and seven genera of birds (li, 2009) . studies have shown that in addition to humans, at least six other taxa of mammals (sheep, cattle, horses, dogs, cats and mice) and two types of birds (seabirds and migratory birds) can be infected by borrelia spirochetes in china (keesing et al., 2009) . previous research used antibodies to detect the borrelia spp. antigen within camel sera in egypt and reported a positive rate of 47.8% (helmy, 2000) . the genus camelus contains three species: camelus dromedaries (onehump dromedary), camelus bactrianus (two-hump bactrian camel), and camelus bactrianus ferus (two-hump bactrian camel). dromedaries are mainly found in the arabian peninsula, the middle east, and parts of africa, whereas bactrian camels are mainly located in central and northeast asia, northern china, and mongolia . camelus bactrianus ferus is a new species of camel, and it is mainly distributed in china and mongolia (guo, 2009) . currently, there are an estimated 250,000 camels, which are mainly distributed in xinjiang and the inner mongolian autonomous region in china (feng, 2016 potential spreaders of lyme disease in china. the exposure of camels to b. burgdorferi s.l. complex was investigated using pcr assay and sequencing. the sequences of the 5s-23s rrna, ospa, flab and 16s rrna genes obtained from positive dna samples were analysed, and the ticks that potentially act as vectors were discussed. the bactrian camel is free-choice grazing animal that inhabits desert regions. a total of 138 blood specimens from bactrian camels were collected during may 2014 and november 2015 in two lb-endemic localities at three sites in northwest china (gansu (zhangye) and xinjiang (ili and aksu)) ( fig. 1) . each blood sample was collected from the jugular vein of the camel into a sterile tube containing an anticoagulant (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, edta). genomic dna was extracted from individual specimens using a commercial qiaamp dna blood kit (qiagen, maryland, usa) and a qiaamp dna mini kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the extracted genomic dna samples were then stored at −20°c until use. a nested pcr for the detection of b. burgdorferi s.l. was carried out using four independent sets of species-specific primers to amplify the 5s-23s rrna, ospa, flab and 16s rrna genes, as described in previous studies (zhang et al., 2014; postic et al., 1994; guy and stanek, 1991; wodecka, 2007; ni et al., 2014; zhai et al., 2017) . the primer sequences are shown in table 1 . first-round pcr reactions were performed in a thermocycler (biorad, hercules, ca, usa) with a total volume of 25 μl containing 2.5 μl of 10× pcr buffer (mg2+ plus), 2.0 μl of each dntp at 2.5 mm, 1.25 u of taq dna polymerase (takara, dalian, china), 1.0 μl of template dna, 1.0 μl of each primer (10 pmol), and 17.25 μl of distilled water. the pcr conditions were as follows: 4 min of denaturation at 94°c; 35 cycles of 94°c for 30 s, annealing for 30 s (annealing temperatures of primers are listed in table 1 ), and 72°c for 30-48 s (depending on amplicon size); with a final extension step at 72°c for 10 min. nested pcr reactions included 1 μl of the first-round pcr product as template for another 30 cycles with the same parameters and annealing temperature profile as described above and in table 1 . to avoid cross-contamination and sample carryover, pre-and post-pcr processing and pcr amplification was performed in separate rooms. b. garinii sz genomic dna (from lanzhou veterinary research institute) was used as a positive control, while distilled water was used as a negative control. pcr products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and some positive amplicons from the second round of pcr amplification were directly used for sequencing (genewiz, inc. beijing china) or cloned into pgem-t easy vector (promega, madison, wi, usa). positive colonies were then selected for pcr amplification and sequencing. all the sequences obtained in this study were subjected to blast search via the ncbi website (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi) using the blastn program. multiple sequence alignment was executed in florence corpet (http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/). phylogenetic analysis was performed using mega 6.06 software (tamura et al., 2013) . phylogenetic trees of borrelia spp. strains were constructed using all the sequences generated in this study and related sequences previously deposited in genbank to show the relationships between different strains. a 95% confidence interval (95% ci) for the overall prevalence value of each borrelia spp. strain was calculated using ibm spss statistics version 19.0. all 8 sequences of borrelia spp. 16s rrna (including 3 sequences fig. 2 . phylogenetic tree of the 16s rrna gene sequences of borrelia species obtained in the present study and those deposited in genbank from different countries;

bootstrap values are shown at each branch point. numbers above the branch reflect bootstrap support from 500 replications. all sites of the alignment containing insertions-deletions or missing data were eliminated from the analysis (option \"complete deletion\"). from ili city and 5 sequences from aksu city) were deposited in genbank under the following accession numbers: ky284013-ky284020 (among them, aku1 = aku3-12, aku3 = aku3-14, aku4 = aku3-38, and aku5 = aku3-45). the sequences of the borrelia spp. 5s-23s rrna gene, including 2 sequences from zhangye city and 2 sequences from aksu city, were deposited in genbank under the following accession numbers: ku865304-ku865307. two sequences of the borrelia spp. flab gene from aksu city were deposited in genbank with the following accession numbers: ku865318-ku865319. two sequences of the borrelia spp. ospa gene from zhangye city were deposited in genbank with the following accession numbers: ku865317 and ky328701. the blood samples collected from a total of 138 bactrian camels in the field two chinese provinces were screened for the presence of borrelia spp. by nested pcrs based on four gene loci. the samples were amplified, and the pcr products had lengths of 253-622 bp for the four genes. the results of the nested pcr amplification for positive sample screenings are summarized in table 2 . of these specimens, 4 tested positive for 5s-23s rrna, 2 tested positive for ospa, 2 tested positive for flab and 8 tested positive for 16s rrna, with positive rates of 2.9% (95% ci = 0.1-16.3), 1.4% (95% ci = 0.1-14.9), 1.4% (95% ci = 0.1-10.6) and 5.8% (95% ci = 1.3-18.5), respectively. (the sample zy53 was detected from both 5s-23s rrna and ospa, the samples aku3-12 and aku3-18 were detected from both 5s-23s rrna and 16s rrna, and the samples aku3-14 and aku3-45 were detected fig. 3 . phylogenetic tree of the 5s-23s rrna gene sequences of borrelia species obtained in the present study and those deposited in genbank from different countries;

bootstrap values are shown at each branch point. numbers above the branch reflect bootstrap support from 500 replications. all sites of the alignment containing insertions-deletions or missing data were eliminated from the analysis (option \"complete deletion\"). from both flab and 16s rrna). at least one b. burgdorferi s.l. gene was detected in 5 of the 138 blood samples examined (3.6%, 95% ci = 0.2-17.9). sequence analysis of the positive pcr products of the 4 genes assayed in this study revealed that the sequences were most similar to those of b. garinii based on the 16s rrna, 5s-23s rrna and flab gene sequences (100%, 85-100%, and 96-100% identity, respectively) (genbank accession numbers: cp007564, dq102468 and cp007564) and were also similar to b. burgdorferi (100%, 100%, and 98-100% identity, respectively) (genbank accession numbers: af210138, kp400556 and cp009657). interestingly, a novel borrelia genospecies (genbank accession number: ky284014) was identified from the ili region, which had a high identity with b. theileri kat (99.5%, genbank accession number: kf569941), which was detected from rhipicephalus geigyi, and with borrelia sp., with 99.8% identity (genbank accession number: ab897890), which was detected from haemaphysalis ticks collected from wild sika deer (cervus nippon yesoensis) from hokkaido, japan, based on 16s rrna. phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the identified borrelia spp. 16s rrna (n = 8), 5s-23s rrna (n = 4), flab (n = 2) and ospa (n = 2) gene sequences by the neighbour-joining method using the software mega 6.06 ( fig. 2-5) . the phylogenetic tree based on 16s rrna sequences indicated that the 16s rrna gene sequences (5 from aksu, 3 from ili) from our study formed three distinct clades. the five aku (aksu) strains cluster within a sub-clade of one of three main clades, forming a sister clade with the b. garinii 16s rrna sequences from china. interestingly, the strains from the ili area belonged to two different clades, with two sequences of b. garinii and b. burgdorferi belonging to the ld borrelia spp. group and one sub-clade of b. theileri belonging to rf borrelia spp. group. in general, the results show the presence of high heterogeneity among the 16s rrna sequences of the 8 different borrelia species strains (fig. 2) . the 5s-23s rrna sequences formed two distinct clades: 4 strains (2 from aksu and 2 from zhangye) formed two distinct sub-clusters in the borrelia 5s-23s rrna phylogenetic tree (fig. 3) . the 5s-23s rrna sequences from the 2 aksu strains (aku3-12 = aku2 of 16s rrna, aku3-38 = aku4 of 16s rrna) and one zhangye borrelia spp. strain belong to one clade of the same branch, which are sister to b. garinii 16s rrna. one zhangye strain of the 5s-23s rrna sequence was located within the same branch (fig. 3) . a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on all the borrelia flab sequences deposited in genbank and two sequences (aku3-14 = aku3 of 16s rrna and aku3-45 = aku5 of 16s rrna) obtained in this study. the flab sequences from borrelia spp. formed two main clades. the   fig. 4 . phylogenetic tree of the flab gene sequences of borrelia species obtained in the present study and those deposited in genbank from different countries; accession numbers are shown after isolate names. the flab gene sequences obtained in this study are indicated by bold triangles. the tree was inferred using the neighbour-joining method of mega 6.06; bootstrap values are shown at each branch point. numbers above the branch reflect bootstrap support from 500 replications. all sites of the alignment containing insertions-deletions or missing data were eliminated from the analysis (option \"complete deletion\"). sequences of the two aksu strains clustered together with the b. garinii flab sequences (fig. 4) . two distinct clades were formed from the sequences of the borrelia spp. ospa phylogenetic tree. the sequences of two strains from zhangye clustered with the b. burgdorferi ospa sequences (fig. 5) . in china, lyme disease is caused by various borrelia spirochetes. many of these agents are highly pathogenic to both humans and animals (liu et al., 2000) . previous studies reported the prevalence of borrelia in field-collected blood samples from cattle, sheep, dogs, rabbits and rats from different areas in china. these studies primarily used serological detection methods and showed that the distribution of borrelia varied considerably in the different areas (hou et al., 2010; wan et al., 1998) . the areas of zhangye city, gansu province, and of ili city and aksu city of xinjiang province all include desert regions and are located along the old silk road, halfway between eastern asia and europe, in areas where international livestock trade and travel were frequent (takada et al., 2001) . bactrian camels were important transportation for trade and travel in the desert within these regions. the bactrian camel can harbour and spread many zoonoses, such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), anaplasma, toxoplasma gondii, onchocerca, trypanosoma evansi, and parabronema skrjabini luo, 2012; wang et al., 2013; yang et al., 2004; yang et al., 2008) . ticks are one of the most significant vectors of borrelia burgdorferi s.l. and rf (relapsing fever). domestic animals, rodents, and many other wild animals host ticks, and animals bitten by infected ticks can acquire the pathogen and serve as natural reservoirs. the detection of b. burgdorferi s.l. using pcr is an alternative method that can be used to improve the control and prevention of lyme disease. according to the nested pcr results, 138 field-collected blood samples assayed with primers targeting the 16s rrna, 5s-23s rrna, flab, and ospa genes revealed 8 (5.8%), 4 (2.9%), 2 (1.4%) and 2 (1.4%) positive samples, respectively, from three regions of two provinces in china where these camels live. according to our knowledge, this is the first report of borrelia spp. infection in camels in china, indicating their reservoir role in the maintenance of this organism in the environment. the 16s rrna gene sequences of borrelia spp. detected from the aksu region had the highest infection rate (11.6%), followed by the ili region (6.1%). the genetic identity of b. burgdorferi fig. 5 . phylogenetic tree of the ospa gene sequences of borrelia species obtained in the present study and those deposited in genbank from different countries; accession numbers are shown after isolate names. the ospa gene sequences obtained in this study are indicated by bold triangles. the tree was inferred using the neighbour-joining method of mega 6.06; bootstrap values are shown at each branch point. numbers above the branch reflect bootstrap support from 500 replications. all sites of the alignment containing insertions-deletions or missing data were eliminated from the analysis (option \"complete deletion\"). spirochetes can be clarified by their differential reactivity with genospecies-specific pcr primers targeting the 5s-23s rrna intergenic spacer amplicon gene. genetic heterogeneity should be further classified by analysing longer sequence data among b. burgdorferi strains that have been previously identified as the same genospecies of atypical strains of borrelia spirochetes (mathiesen jr et al., 1997; postic et al., 1998) . moreover, the 16s rrna gene was detected at a higher positive rate in blood examined for borrelia spirochetes than other genes in previous research (wodecka et al., 2010) . our study showed that the infection rate of these genes decreased in the order 16s rrna > 5s-23s rrna > flab > ospa. two borrelia species, b. garinii and b. burgdorferi s.s., were identified, and b. garinii was found to be widely distributed in camels in china. in the present study, b. garinii and b. burgdorferi s.s. were identified in camels from aksu and ili in xinjiang province. sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that those isolates were closely related to the corresponding genotypes based on 16s rrna gene with high sequence similarities (99.4%-100%, genbank accession numbers: cp007564; 100%, genbank accession numbers: ay342028), although the bootstrap values of the phylogenetic tree were relatively low. this finding suggested the genetic diversity of b. garinii and b. burgdorferi s.s in different hosts and geographic locations. interestingly, the sequencing of cloned pcr products from the 16s rrna gene of borrelia spp. from the ili region showed the presence of a new borrelia species belonging to the relapsing fever group. the 16s rrna gene sequence of borrelia sp. obtained from camel has a 99.5%, 99.8% and 99.8% similarity to the gene of b. theileri kat strain, borrelia sp. 120618d12 and borrelia sp. 130707_13_hjf, respectively (genbank accession numbers: kf569941, ab897890 and ab897891). b. theileri belongs to the rf borrelia spp. group and is the causative agent of bovine borreliosis. it was initially identified in cattle and subsequently in goats, sheep and deer from africa, south america, mexico and australia (l, 1903; mathiesen jr et al., 1997) . most of the rf borrelia spp. are transmitted by soft-bodied ticks, but b. theileri is found in hard-bodied ticks and is transmitted by rhipicephalus spp., including r. annulatus, r. decoloratus, r. microplus and r. evertsi (barbour et al., 2005; smith et al., 1985; trees, 1978) . this study provides the first report of b. theileri in camel blood samples in china. at present, b. burgdorferi has been isolated from nine ixodes ticks: i. acutitarsus, i. persulcatus, i. granulatus, h. longicornis, h. bispinosa, h. concinna, h. formosensis, boophilus microplus and d. silvarum (niu et al., 2009) . a previous study reported that the borrelia isolates were isolated from d. marginatus collected from camels in xinjiang, china, and these isolates were genetically identified as b. burgdorferi sensu stricto . the blood samples from bactrian camels in this study were donated by dr. li, who reported that there are ticks available to be collected from these bactrian camels that have been identified as belonging to h. asiaticum, h. dromedarii, r. sanguineus group, and d. niveus . thus, these tick species might act as potential vectors to carry and transfer borrelia spp. that cause camel borreliosis in china. further study is required to determine whether these ticks are competent vectors for borrelia spp. in conclusion, we successfully identified infection with borrelia spirochetes from camel blood samples from different geographic locations of gansu province and xinjiang province in china. b. garinii and b. burgdorferi s.s. were highly prevalent in the sampling areas of the two provinces surveyed. further studies concerning the prevalence of borrelia spp. groups for both lyme disease and relapsing fever should be performed to confirm the presence of these different borrelia species in camels within china. our findings suggest that borrelia infection in camels could potentially present a concern for public health. more detailed and widespread monitoring of tick populations and the screening for borrelia in a greater variety of hosts are warranted in future studies.\n",

      ";  290000  the anxiety and trauma associated with the tragic coronavirus disease pandemic coded, covid-19 led many to indulge in various unorthodox preventive measures such as the extensive indiscriminate use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (abhs), abuse, misuse, overdose of prescription drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate globally. while some preventive measures are recommended and adopted, such as national lockdown, self-isolation, quarantine, stay-at-home model, avoidance of large gathering, social distancing, wearing of face-masks and hand gloves, periodic hand washing particularly with liquid soaps/detergents under running tap water, avoidance of touching the face among others, the use of abhs has been more prominent. abhs contains on average 60-70 % by weight of one or more alcohols. during the 2019/2020 covid-19 pandemic, the use of abhs was more renowned to the extent that some individuals recommended the application on the hands every 30 minutes for a period of at least 20 seconds while outside the home. though, the periodic application of the hand sanitizers seems like an effective on-the-go solution to preventing the spread of the virus, many other associated hazards call for caution. besides transdermal absorption leading to mortality and morbidity of varying degree; alcohol-alcohol adulteration, deliberate and unintentional ingestion of abhs may result in respiratory depression, irreversible blindness, intoxication, cirrhosis, acidosis, headache, central nervous system depression, seizure, hypoglycemia, coma, or even death in some cases. the non-abhs are equally not absolutely safe as many of them contain active agents that are allegedly carcinogenic, toxic, inducing microbial resistance and endocrine disruption. considered together, this implies that while some may not die from contracting the disease, the preventive measures taken could lead to death or other forms of morbidity thereby revealing that there is indeed, death in preventive measures when done without cautionary measures. this study seeks to highlight some associated risks in the use of abhs and non-abhs, whilst advocating the use of safer or 'greener' alternative procedure for use as preventive measures particularly during the covid-19 pandemic. the sudden outbreak of the coronavirus disease epidemic preferably referred to as covid-19 was a tragic global pandemic that claimed over 190,000 lives with over two million reported cases spreading across 210 countries within the first five months (december, 2019 -24 th april, 2020) of the outbreak across the globe (worldometers, 2020) . while the highest toll of mortality remained in china, italy, spain and america as at the end of march, 2020, many asian and tropical african countries such as iran, south africa, algeria, egypt, nigeria and cameroon had got their acrid taste of the pandemic. the fear, anxiety and emotional trauma associated with the outbreak of covid-19 which started from the wuhan province in china in december 2019 was quite rattling, monumental and terrific as many erroneously regarded contracting the infection as a death penalty. in fact, infected individuals who recovered from the disease are stigmatized and disenfranchised, segregated and avoided. the long and short term implications of contracting the disease made citizens of most countries to intensify efforts at preventing the covid-19 disease. while global mortality rate rose to 3.4 % in some countries (worldometers, 2020) , the trauma associated with the infection had no limit. the incident obviously led to improvement in hand hygiene (hh) in order to curtail the spread of the virus. this has brought to limelight the prominence of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, abhs and other non-alcohol based hand sanitizers as well as household disinfectants. as at this moment, there is no vaccine for the prevention of covid-19. the best prevention is to avoid being exposed to the virus (adhikari et al., 2020) . as a result of this, government and individuals adopted various measures in preventing the spread of the disease. the government and health sector' advocacy groups contributed tremendously to the spike in the use of various preventive methods such as city/town and national lockdown, self-isolation, quarantine, stay-at-home model, avoidance of crowd, social distancing, wearing of face-mask and hand gloves, periodic hand washing particularly with liquid soaps/detergents, use of abhs, avoidance of touching the face among others. following unsubstantiated claims, some individuals in the developing countries resulted to the overconsumption of acclaimed immune-boosting substances such as ginger, garlic, lemon fruits, and salt solution etc. besides, some in the tropical countries believed that the hot weather could reduce the chances of survival of the virus, hence, they resulted to staying long hours in the bright day sunlight and/or periodic consumption of hot drinks such as water, tea and juice with the intention of providing an unhealthy high temperature environment for the survival of the infectious virus. some other people resulted to the consumption of food or substances that increases the ph of the body to the alkaline region since there were unsubstantiated claims that the virus does not survive at alkalinic ph. although viruses are sensitive to ph and temperature changes and cannot survive beyond a narrow range (sturman et al., 1990; mi et al., 2019) , a crude means of achieving such could be more deadly than envisaged. moreover, the tentative approval by the united states tentative of chloroquine-based therapy as trial for the management of covid-19 patients on compassionate ground (based on who guideline), led some individuals to an unethical practice of the indiscriminate consumption of chloroquine-based drugs as both prophylaxis and curative. although, initial trials indicated some interesting positive results at minute doses (gao et al., 2020; liu et al., 2020; singh et al., 2020) , reports are still premature and yet to be universally accepted. if clinical data confirm the antiviral activity of chloroquine-based drugs, the novel covid-19 could become one of the cheapest and simplest to treat among infectious respiratory diseases. this is because the drugs are quite affordable (raoult et al., 2020) . the affordability and accessibility of the chloroquine-based drugs partly led to the abuse with resultant lethality and health hazards which included abdominal discomfort, coma and even death in some cases (wong et al., 2011) . in fact, the moderate dose of chloroquine can cause effects such as depression, psychosis, delirium, mood swing, personality change among others (good and shader, 1982) . the close derivative, hydroxychloroquine is also known to possess side effects such as retinal toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, refractory shock and ventricular arrhythmias (fung et al., 2007; rüther et al., 2007; marmor et al., 2016; tsang et al, 2019) . meanwhile, chloroquine phosphate and a few other derivatives have been reported as potential anti-dote to covid-19 infection (gao et al., 2020; sahraei et al., 2020) . although, many of these preventive measures were often adopted, many of them frequently present mild to severe implications with only a few of them proving really potent and safe. in reality, some of the measures were quite detrimental to human health and it could result to death before even contracting the dreaded viral infection, covid-19 (choi et al., 2017; chan and chan, 2018) . while all the measures adopted thus far have both their merits and demerits, this report focuses more on the chemistry of the death and the associated danger, particularly in the use of hand sanitizers and other applied preventive chemicals against the spread of covid-19 as well as other germs. the advent of the covid-19 outbreak marked the commencement of the surge in the series of industrial and domestic-made chemicals like the hand sanitizers, liquid soaps, disinfectants and others. the upsurge in the global consumption of hand sanitizers following the covid-19 pandemic was unprecedentedly geometrical. the use of hand sanitizer became well renowned to the extent that some individuals apply on their hands every 30 minutes especially when outside the home. while the practice seems a plausibly effective on-the-go solution in the prevention of the spread of the viral infection, other serious dangers are quite associated. although, microorganisms pervade almost everywhere human survives (bhoonderowa et al., 2014; kõljalg et al., 2017) and the use of sanitizers can help in minimizing their spread and deleterious effect on human, the frequent use may however pre-dispose users to some degree of fatality (chan et al., 2017; chan and chan, 2018) . various sub-standard brands of hand sanitizers flooded both offline and online markets in the developed and developing countries. besides the hike in the prices of these household products, their acquisition could be tantamount to self-purchase of quicker \"death\". while the chemical composition of the various household antiviral preventive products used is sometimes regional or country-based, some chemicals are more accessible and universal to all. some of them are thus discussed herein. hand sanitizers are hygienic products that are applied on the hands to prevent the spread of microorganisms like viruses, bacterial and fungi such as coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, herpes simplex virus, ebola virus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, traveller diarrhoea among others, especially where access to water is limited (fendler et al., 2002; conover and gibson, 2016; wolfe et al., 2017; thaddeus et al., 2018; kuenzli et al., 2019) . hand sanitizers, though, originally developed for the healthcare sector (ascenzi, 1995; block, 2001) , it has become a routine for many people to carry hand sanitizer with them at all times, especially during the recent disease outbreak. industrial and home-made hand sanitizers are made of various chemical compositions subject to what is locally available. a brief check of brands on the internet, local markets and the literatures indicated two main categories of sanitizers; alcohol-based and non-alcohol-based hand sanitizers (nabhs). the alcohol-based hand sanitizers (abhs) are primarily composed of alcohols such as either ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, propan-1-ol or propan-2-ol; and additives such as colorants, stabilizers, fragrance and sometimes preservatives which may include formaldehyde, parabens among other chemicals (luby et al., 2004 (luby et al., , 2005 kramer et al., 2007; napolitani et al., 2020) . other chemicals usually added for various purposes include polyacrylic acid, glycerin, carbomer, propylene glycol, triethanolamine (trolamine), tetraethylammonium chloride, dichlorodimethylphenol (figure 1) , chlorine, deionized water, and extract of plants (wolfe et al., 2017; thaddeus et al., 2018; surini et al., 2018) . the world health organization guideline for the preparation of abhs revealed the composition to be 80 % ethanol, 1.45 % glycerol and 0.125 % hydrogen peroxide or 75 % isopropyl alcohol, 1.45 % glycerol and 0.125 % hydrogen peroxide (who, 2010) . on the other hand, the non-alcohol based hand sanitizers (nabhs) are made up of various chemicals similar to the component found in the alcohol-based type with the exclusion of alcohol. however, anti-microbial or disinfecting agents such as triclosan (tcs), triclocarban, sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, benzalkonium chloride and benzithonium chloride are often added (hayat and munnawar, 2016; bondurant et al., 2019a) . some of the chemicals used in various disinfectants include chloroxyphenol b, oleum aromaticum, triclosan, triethanolamine, tetraethylammonium, dichlorodimethylphenol, chlorine, etc. it is quite imperative that antimicrobial agents, disinfectants and antiseptics substances possess strong activities against the pathogens including the biofilm-forming pathogens, else antimicrobial resistance could easily develop (bridier et al., 2011; hauser et al., 2016; ghanem et al., 2018) . the assumption has led to the use of extremely strong and sometimes hazardous chemicals as disinfectants. for effectiveness or improved potency, combinations of two or more active ingredients are often used in some anti-viral disinfectants (ahmed et al., 2020) . a newly developed nabhs which contains only 14 % alcohol by volume and usually applied in small volume was reported to work synergistically with the other active agent in the sanitizer via a system called \"quad system technology\" to kill the virus and other germs (cavage, 2010) . generally, in abhs, formulations with ethanol between 60 and 95 % are known to be significantly effective in preventing spread of microbial infections (kramer et al., 2002) and are generally regarded safe (fda, 1994) . who recommends washing of hands under running tap water, and when the resources for that is not available, abhs comes handy. however, the abhs are recommended over the use of soap due to its ease of use and capability in stalling microbial spread (who 2009; hayat and munnawar, 2016) . however, some other potential alternatives such as nonorganic antibiotics and organic or natural biocides have been proposed in place of triclosan due to some of the reported side effects (kim et al., 2007) . many abhs carry a lot of risks. first, most abhs contain alcohols in excess of 60 % which made them to be classified as class i flammable liquid substance as a result of their flash point below 100 °c fahrenheit (kramer et al., 2002; fda, 2020) . precisely, ethanol 80 % (v/v) and isopropyl alcohol 75 % (v/v) have flash points of 17.5 °c and 19 °c, respectively (who, 2020) . this quite indicates that the products can ignite at relatively low temperatures. hence, abhs increase the risk of fire accidents. although, abhs are a more accessible and usually a preferred choice for many people during epidemics like the covid-19 compared to choices like the towelettes (rai et al., 2017 ), yet they carry their own significant risks. the risk associated with the use of the abhs includes accidental poisoning via ingestion, fire hazard, organ toxicity via absorption through the skin among others (figure 2 ). children are often attracted to the nature, smell and cool feel of alcohol on the skin and series of accidental poisonings, including fatal ones in child ren have been reported (chan and chan, 2018) . for instance, investigation carried out on young children who swallowed abhs revealed that they were diagnosed of apnea, acidosis and some even went into coma (rayar and ratnapalan, 2013) . it has been established that younger children have decreased liver glycogen stores, which increases their risk of developing hypoglycemia and have various pharmacokinetic factors, which make them more susceptible to developing toxicity from alcohol (tran et al., 2007; marek and kraft, 2014) . in addition, alcohol-alcohol dilution is a major contamination in the industry. a more affordable alcohol with similar physical properties is sometimes used to adulterate another alcohol for pecuniary profit. if the ethanol for instance, is adulterated with other toxic alcohols such as methanol, irreversible blindness, coma or even death could result (gormley et al., 2012; forrester, 2015; moore, 2019) . methanol is known to be more lethal than ethanol as unintentional ingestion by children and deliberate consumption by older subjects often lead to poisoning requiring prompt antidotal therapy, critical care in addition to other supporting therapy (chan and chan, 2018) . methanol is reportedly more toxic when inhaled, or exposed to human orally or through the skin. alcohol concentration in the blood could increase via absorption through the skin when used frequently. due to its toxicity, it is therefore strongly not recommended for use in hand sanitizers. however, some reports indicated that such contaminations have been observed in abhs (mowry et al., 2015; chan and chan, 2018) . transdermal poisoning resulting from skin absorption of methanol is well reported (qiao and guo, 1992; ryu et al., 2016) . in fact, exposure to methanol was reported to cause multiple sclerosis (henzi, 1984) . other types of alcohol-alcohol intoxication and poisoning have been reported (chan et al., 2017; chan and chan, 2018) . the commonly used alcohol in abhs, ethanol, is a known toxicant and central nervous (cns) depressant capable of inducing hypoglycemia (baum 2017; moore, 2019) . the use of isopropanol-based hand sanitizers carries equal or even greater risk than ethanol-based counterparts. isopropanol besides being intoxicating, it is converted in the liver to acetone (propanone) which causes greater cns depression than ethanol (litovitz, 1986) . various deaths and morbidities associated with abhs have been reported (gormley et al., 2012; darracq et al., 2013; jones et al., 2013; forrester, 2015; basyal et al., 2018; moore, 2019) . interestingly, there has been emerging cases of alcohol-tolerant microorganisms which therefore cast aspersion on the future of the use of alcohol in hand sanitizers (pidot et al., 2018; bondurant et al., 2019b) . it is predicted that more organisms would develop resistance to alcohol in the near future if indiscriminate discharge to the environment is not controlled. other adverse health effects that could result from both abhs and nabhs include ocular irritation, vomiting, conjunctivitis, oral irritation, cough, and abdominal pain (qiao and guo, 1992; choi et al., 2017; chan and chan, 2018) . in some rare scenario, adverse effects could include acidosis, respiratory depression, headache, hypoglycemia, irreversible blindness, central nervous system depression, seizure, coma and death (figure 2 ). these effects are noted to be more severe in abhs (bonner, 2017; choi et al., 2017; chan and chan, 2018) . the continuous use or overuse of hand sanitizers can cause chronic irritation and severe skin breakdown among other effects (qiao and guo, 1992) , especially in children. a study that reported the incidences of poisoning associated with abhs between 2011 and 2014 indicated that children below 12 years had incidences of over 70,000 exposures to hand sanitizers, of which 92 % are due to abhs with only 8 % nabhs exposure (bonner, 2017) . furthermore, the continuous topical application of ethanol on the skin was reported to lower skin barrier functions, thereby rending the membrane highly susceptible to harmful chemicals in soaps and cosmetics (lachenmeier, 2008) . moreso, percutaneous toxicity could also occur in children with lacerated skin (lachenmeier, 2008) . in fact, the potential for abuse of abhs has raised more concern now than before. although, abhs seem easier to use and proved higher efficiency than some detergent-based sanitizers, the repeated exposure of users to the abhs calls for caution (perez et al., 2019) . triclosan (tcs: 2, 4, 4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether) is a universal antimicrobial agent that has found its way into many pharmaceuticals and personal care products as well as in the promotion of growth in animal including aquatic species (daughton and ternes, 1999) . it is used as antibacterial agent in many consumers' and household products such as medicated soaps, hand sanitizers, deodorants, toothpastes, air fresheners and other cosmetic products (sethuraman et al., 2014) . it is currently being considered as an emerging contaminant (wang et al., 2018) . triclosan with its related compound, triclocarban ( figure 1 ) used in consumer's products such as liquid soaps and hand sanitizers previous mentioned is of paramount concerns to scientists due to its long persistency in the environment (fda, 2016; usgs, 2016) . its ability to cause disruption of the endocrine (hormone) system is still being evaluated and already recommended to be avoided (bonner, 2017; stoker et al., 2010) . it was classed as a pesticide in the national pesticide information retrieval system (npirs [triclosan], 2020) of the united states. previously, hexachlorophene, an organochlorine compound known as nabac (figure 1 ) with structural similarity to triclosan had been banned as disinfectant by the fda following health concerns due to the allegedly associated teratogenicity (iarc, 1998; halden, 2014) . tcs together with bisphenol a were reported to possess potential to weaken the immune system (clayton et al., 2011) . tcs is reported to cause oxidative stress and induce genotoxicity in goldfish, suggesting a potential ecotoxicological risk to aquatic ecosystems (stasinakis et al., 2008; halden, 2014; silva et al., 2015) . tcs has been reported as persistent organic pollutants that are retained for months or years in water bodies (lygina et al., 2013) . antibiotics abuse, overuse and misuse of soaps and hand sanitizers is often responsible for effects such as antibiotics resistance and endocrine disruption (atolani et al. 2016; lu et al., 2018) . tcs, a typical antibiotic is commonly used in many soap preparations and some hand sanitizers are known to produce high anti-microbial efficiency. however, many studies have implicated it as a source of induction of antibiotic resistant microorganisms as the use of only 0.2 mg/l tcs for only 30 days can cause multi-drug resistance to escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus of which similar effects were not reported for chlorhexidine or hydrogen peroxide-based agents ( westgate et al., 2016) . the use of alcohol in abhs is equally not absolutely safe as it can easily be absorbed through the skin. reports indicated that blood concentration of ethanol could reach 2.3 % within 90 minutes of use of abhs (kramer et al., 2007) . in the study, ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations were as high as 1.7 and 1.95 mg/l respectively. ethanol is often converted to acetaldehyde which is also absorbed into the blood stream (thompson et al., 2005; npirs [ethanol] 2020). the metabolic products are often more toxic in the human system. high concentration of ethanol in human blood ingested via consumption of alcoholic beverages is known to cause both short-term and long-term toxicity such as inebriation and liver cirrhosis. hence, the use of abhs could invariably lead to increased concentration of alcohol in human blood (kramer et al., 2007) . there are increasing incidences of intentional ingestion of ethanol-containing hand sanitizers especially by alcohol addicts (gormley et al., 2012) . since children are attracted to the scent, bright coloration and the attractive packaging of abhs, they are generally more at risk (rayar and ratnapalan, 2013) . within 2011 -2016, u.s. poison control centers reported over 100,000 calls with regards to children exposure to hand sanitizer (georgia poison center, 2015; cdc, 2020b) .the intoxication by the ingestion of hand sanitizers is a major overlooked risk seeking urgent attention globally (jones et al., 2013; raza et al., 2014; moore, 2019) . high degree of morbidity and mortality are risks associated with the use of abhs (santos et al., 2017) . therefore, following the proliferation in the production of abhs due to the covid-19 pandemic, there is an obvious need for global caution and conscientiousness in the acquisition and utilization of hand sanitizers. it was reported that most germs or microbial pathogens cannot survive adequate washing with liquid soaps. the structure of most pathogenic bacterial and virus is less resistant to the potency of the alkalinity, the corrosive nature and membrane-shattering ability of most liquid soaps. while the proper washing with the liquid soaps kills the pathogens up to 99.9 % the rinsing with clean water helps to eliminate the dead organisms from hands. most liquid soaps are water-based; hence, this naturally reduces the skin penetrating effect of some of the components compared to abhs. most hand-sanitizers usually organic-based are also known to kill pathogen up to 99.9 % when effectively rubbed on the hand, but the absorption potential through human skin to some vital organs such as the kidney and liver could result to toxicities such as nephrotoxicity, cirrhosis among others (kramer et al., 2007; choi et al., 2017; chan and chan, 2018) . since hh is of paramount importance to the prevention of the spread of virus and other germs, the use of safe hand rub, soap, or sanitizers is imperative. due to associated toxicities and side effects, some hand rubs, soaps and sanitizers contain some chemical compounds which may only be most appropriate for use on non-skin surfaces such as the surfaces of furniture, door handles, walls, phones, glass, toilet zincs, metal tools, vehicles exteriors, electronic gadgets, hospital equipment among others and not on human skin. in order to underscore the relevance of alcohol in disinfection of non-skin objects, a study reported that a single cleaning with an alcohol wipe proved higher potency than the alcoholbased hand rub in decontamination of stethoscopes used in hospitals (mehta et al., 2010) . other studies also showed that use of hand sanitizers used outside hospital environment do not show superior benefit to soap (oughton et al., 2009; cdc, 2020a) . hence, washing with soap and warm water with good hh may adequately suffice for homes and as well eliminate exposure to hazardous chemicals and consecutive release to the environment (wolf et al., 2018) . the cdc and some other reports indicated that besides preserving good environmental flora, washing with soap and water produces better or equivalent results compared to abhs sanitizers at removing or killing certain types of virus such as the noroviruses and other germs (grayson et al., 2009; blaney et al., 2011; bondurant et al., 2019a; cdc, 2020b) . hand sanitizers usually end-up being deposited in high concentrations of the constituting chemical residues (contaminants) in the environmental soil and water bodies. high concentration of these chemicals released in the environment could trigger multi-drug resistance (westgate et al., 2016) . antimicrobial resistance is obviously a major public health concern globally. the world health organization (who) reported that about 700,000 people died due to antimicrobial-resistant infections every year (who, 2019). it is further predicted that the death due to antimicrobial-resistant infections could reach 10 million annually by 2050 if no concrete action is taken now (who, 2019). experiment has revealed that washing with ordinary soap solution is effective at killing and eliminating the virus and other germs in the hand. the fatty outer surface of the virus is denatured by the soap molecule and that process leads to the destruction of the virus which is washed away by water. it is worth mentioning that hand washing with soap solution and rinsing with water (preferably warm water) will kill and eliminate the germs from the surface, using of abhs will kill the organism without eliminating them from the surface. the use of soap and water must be a preferred choice when the hand is visibly or grossly contaminated. abhs also do not remove pesticide from the hand (cdc, 2020b). the use of abhs in such instances could make the hand so messy and unpleasant. in fact, the food and drug administration (fda) of the united states already banned the use of triclosan in antibacterial soaps (iarc, 1998; halden, 2014 ). recent advances in the cosmetic industry have led to the production of safe hand sanitizers obtained via green process. this involved the incorporation of safe natural antiseptic agents into soaps, hand rubs or nabhs in place of the synthetic ones that are associated with multiple side effects. natural products such as plant extracts, exudates, purified isolates and essential oils have been proposed as germ-killers in hand sanitizers, soaps and other cosmetics and body care products (ningsih et al., 2017; hartatik, 2014; lateh, 2015; surini et al., 2018; zubair et al., 2018a, b; atolani et al., 2019a, b; 2020) . natural products such as coconut oil have been used to produce hand sanitizers with enhanced cosmetic properties (tran et al., 2019) . such green alternative will preserve the natural environment and the skin of people (atolani et al., 2016) . following the multiple side-effects associated with the use of abhs and some liquid soaps due to the \"unsafe\" active agents in them, the following recommendations have become inevitable: i) manufacturers and health care providers should advocate the potential dangers associated with abuse, overuse and misuse of abhs and antibacterial active soaps. ii) the habitual use of abhs must be deliberately avoided. as much as it is possible, its use should be occasional when other options such as soap and warm water are not available. this would impact safety of both users and the environment. iii) users should only purchase small amount of abhs at a time to avoid overt addiction and abuse due to the surplus. iv) the use of hand sanitizer should be limited to only the finger and wrist region as absorption via the arm and other body parts could be increased thereby raising blood alcohol concentration within a short time. v) when the use of abhs is unavoidable, users should ensure use of low concentration alcohol at an average of 60-70 % as higher concentrations could be more deleterious. vi) the abhs should be kept far away from heat, flame, spark-source or any oxidizing agents to avoid fire incidence since they are flammable. vii) children should not be allowed direct access to abhs as the fatality of accidental ingestion in children is worse and incidences are on the rise. viii) in case of liquid soaps; soaps with triclosan or triclocarban and other questionable safety profile should be avoided. ix) there should be incorporation of skin protecting emollient in abhs and liquid soap in order to prevent after-use skin dryness, skin breaking/cracking as well as reduce alcohol penetration through the skin. x) general cleanliness and good hygiene is imperative to keep microbial infections at bay. consistent tidiness will minimize the need for repetitive use of liquid soaps and abhs. the enormous release of adulterated and uncontrolled infection-preventing household products such as the antibacterial active liquid soap and abhs in the global markets have several potential adverse health effects on human such as dehydrated skin, irritation, poisoning, and cancer among others. thus, the careful adoption of hand washing with selected safe liquid soap should be encouraged by all. improvement in hand hygiene is akin to the containment of the spread of germs, including the ravaging viral infection, covid-19. however, when the use of hand sanitizer is inevitable, consumers should be cautious of the chemical constituents as well as the concentration of each constituent. these measures are important to the prevention of avoidable implications such as unintentional or deliberate ingestion or chemical absorption through the skin which could lead to incidences such as irreversible blindness, depression, intoxication, liver cirrhosis, acidosis, headache, central nervous system depression, seizure, hypoglycemia, coma and death. while preventing infections such as the covid-19 and other microbial-induced infections, slow and systematic death should be meticulously avoided. otherwise, the prevention mode could lead to higher fatality than the infection being avoided.\n",

      ";  300000  measures for public safety. nasopharyngeal (np) and oropharyngeal (op) swabs have been recommended for the detection of 2019-ncov by who. researchers have proven that np swab specimen was superior to the op swab specimen for the examination of 2019-ncov [2] . however, np swabs are not the optimal specimen for many reasons. firstly, healthcare workers are at a great risk of infection due to the production of aerosol during the sampling. secondly, the quality of np swabs is inconsistent between collections, which may lead to the occurrence of false-negative results. thirdly, patient may experience discomfort, including pain, itchy and bleeding, during the sampling. the biggest advantage of sputum specimen is its noninvasive characteristics, but only 28% of patients with covid-19 have sputum symptom [3] . throat washing is a non-invasive and easy-access sample, which can remarkedly reduce the chance of exposing healthcare workers to 2019-ncov. more epithelial cells, which can enhance the positive detection rate of 2019-ncov, are acquired by forcing the cricopharyngeal muscle to oscillate over posterior pharyngeal wall with sterile normal saline. in view of the aforementioned advantages, throat washings have been utilized for the screening of 2019-ncov in this study. the comparations of efficacy between throat washings and np swabs were also performed in this paper. the study was performed in accordance with the principles of the declaration of helsinki and approved  throat washing was harvested by asking patient to oscillate over posterior pharyngeal wall with 20 ml sterile normal saline. after 5-10 seconds, spit out normal saline from their throat to a sterile container. np swabs were sampled as described previously [2] . results 11 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 participants were enrolled in this study, including 6 remain hospitalized subjects and 5 discharged subjects. among them, there were 9 males and 2 females, aged from 26 to 83 years. 24 paired throat washings and np swabs, including 5 in discharged patients and 19 in hospitalized, were performed. samples were collected at a median of 53 days after symptom onset (range: 48-57 days). among them, 14 paired throat washings and np swabs were both negative for the detection of 2019-ncov. however, the other 5 paired samples got inconsistent results, of which the throat washing specimen showed positive and the np swabs presented negative results. using the chisquared test, we identified positive testing rate of throat washing was much higher than that of np swabs (p=0.031) (table1). throat washings have been firstly introduced as the specimen for the detection of 2019-ncov in this study. 24 series of paired throat washings and np swabs specimens were evaluated, and we found throat washing specimen was significantly superior to the np swab specimen for its higher positive detection rate of 2019-ncov nucleic acid. variations in the detection of virus nucleic acid with different samples have been confirmed [5] [6] . it is well recognized that np swabs were more sensitive than op swabs for the inspection of 2019-ncov nucleic acid (89% vs 54%, p＜0.001) [2] . in spite of the high positive detection rate, the risk of exposure to 2019-ncov did not improve by using np swabs samples. moreover, as we mentioned before, the application of np swab was limited for its own disadvantages. sputum was a useful non-invasive method for the detection of 2019-ncov, but still confined to the occurrence of sputum. induced-sputum was identified as an unsafe inappropriate specimen for the production of aerosol [7] . therefore, there is an urgent need for a novel optimal sampling plan. a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 6 saliva specimen can be easily obtained by noninvasive techniques and its application could remarkedly minimize the risk of 2019-ncov transmission [8] . researchers also found descending trend of 2019-ncov viral load by using saliva specimens, indicating the important role of saliva in early detection [9] . another study has also interpreted the potential role of saliva for the detection of 2019-ncov [10] . however, the efficiency comparison between saliva specimen and np swabs, whose validity and reliability has been certified in previous studies, has not yet been described. throat washing is a promising candidate for 2019-ncov screening due to its safety and reliability. its utility and efficacy in 2019-ncov detection have been well described in this study. the number of laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases is increasing day by day with a shortage of medical healthcare workers. throat washing may play a potential role to reduce the workload of sampling. there are limitations in our study. sample size is small for the decrease of covid-19 cases in china. the decline of 2019-ncov viral load in patients enrolled in this study, whose sampling time was long after symptom onset, may have contributed to the low overall positive detection rate of 2019-ncov. \n",
